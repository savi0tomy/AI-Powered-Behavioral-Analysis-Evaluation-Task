1j7rxfd,depression,I miss my parents despite their abuse,"This past month I really realized I have no family and friends will drop you the minute things get hard. I moved out my parents when I was 18 due to my mom crashing out and beating me down one night (not uncommon). I’m 21 now. I’m living with my older sister and her husband. I’ve had no stability. I feel like a burden to them and everyone else around me. I can’t afford to be on my own. My sister is mildly bipolar and switches up on me every now and then. I try to stay out of everyone’s way and keep to myself. I’ve been chasing stability since moving out. I broke up with an abusive ex who manipulated me and made me feel worthless and beneath him, really he was jealous of me and was upset I was doing pretty well on my own. He really fucked me with my self image and self worth. I recently quit my job that was emotionally wrecking me and am working a corporate job and not getting enough hours so money is insanely stressful. My sister is not giving me a break and I feel like none of my family truly understands the turmoil I have been through these last 3 years. I moved 5 times, lived in literal squalor, left two jobs that broke a part of me every chance they got, dealt with self harm and was shut down everytime expressing it. I feel like everyone would prefer if I wasn’t around and my sister is already expressing her frustration of me not being able to pay more money or contribute financially. As I’m literally pulling money out of my hard earned savings to pay rent and bills. I wish I had a mom. At the very least my parents gave me a stable roof over my head and food on the table. I feel stupid and sometimes it’s really scary because I don’t know if I’m ready to be an adult and be on my own because I was so sheltered growing up. I hate that I miss my parents despite what they put me through growing up. I just want a mom to be able to run to and hug when I feel like dying. I hate how this is how my life has turned out to be. I always just wanted a family who I could always turn to and know I was safe.

1j7pcmk,depression,Can someone please say something kind?,"  
Hi, I'm 27F and have been unemployed for almost a year now. I went through an incredibly traumatic breakup a couple years ago, which has lead to me losing the majority of my friends (since most have chosen my ex over me). I never thought I would be alone like this, and I don't know what I've done to drive people away. Many people say I'm sweet and thoughtful, yet I now find myself completely alone.

  
I've been struggling with feeling suicidal for the past several months, and I recently finally confided in my best friend, but they did not do anything after I told them. It was devastating, and since then I have told no one else other than my therapist. I'm really terrified of reaching out again for help and getting nothing in response, since it has already happened several times. I'm also so terrified that showing my depression unmasked will drive away the few distant friends I have left.

  
Can someone please tell me my life isn't over? Or give me some advice or reassurance? I feel so behind, and I just want to have friends, and a purpose, but I don't know how to start over when I feel too old and too defeated to do so. I just want to love and be loved, but I'm always alone. I don't know how to feel present and in control of my life, and I'm so tired of just waiting for the days to end. Time is moving so fast and I just want to live, but I'm not living right now.

  
I know this is a very tall order, so alternatively I would really appreciate any feel good/funny content/shows I could use as a distraction :') ",4,9,1741576624.0,"Can someone please say something kind?

1j7ocqy,depression,Death seems the only reasonable solution,"Treatment resistant depression and the associated substance abuse has led me to the conclusion that not existing is actually in my best interest. When I was a child, the concept of not existing filled me with a continual terror. In my late teens, depression of the persistent variety invaded my life and I have been in a living hell ever since. 

On a good day, I experience anhedonia and may have energy to get some stuff done. On a bad day, I am in full-blown existential despair that is so heavy I can barely speak, much less function in any meaningful way. It is the loneliest feeling on earth and is accompanied by a shame that makes me yearn for death. For a long time the fear of death has prevented me from doing what ultimately needs to be done, but that is slowly beginning to fade. When I think of ending it all, it is as if this monstrous world cannot hurt me, since I can return to my true home, which is non-existence. There is no more feeling like an alien in this indifferent world. I’ve never truly felt at home here. People always talk about preserving the planet, but I could give two shits about the planet that could kill me without batting an eye. Nature is blind, violent, and creates untold sufferings for all of the creatures unlucky enough to be a byproduct chemical reactions. 

Life was beautiful at one point. Even though I was raised around addiction and mental illness (one close family member even threatened murder/suicide when I was 11, where I experienced life and death terror), I still had a joy for simply being alive. That is no longer the case. I not only have lost the joy in life but suffer every day with fear, despair and depression. 

Im exhausted. Too exhausted to work. Too exhausted to socialize. Too exhausted for a romantic relationship. When I was 26 I was a decorated combat veteran with an engineering degree. Now, at 38 I’m unemployable and can barely buy groceries without having a panic attack. Every few months I have a horrible relapse on drugs, which only digs me deeper in my hole. The shame I carry for this is absolutely brutal. I’m an attractive man in good physical shape, an engineering degree, and am easy to get along with, yet I am confined to the couch. I feel like the biggest loser in the history of mankind. I’ve recently relapsed again after nearly a year of sobriety. This has happened many times. People around me are understandably frustrated and losing patience. I feel like an absolute burden with nothing to offer humanity. 

I’ve tried everything: exercising regularly, eating right, forcing myself to socialize, meditation, medication, counseling, psychedelic therapy…all to no avail. I can safely say that I have finally come to that bitter realization that I would be better off nullifying myself. 

Sure, those around me will suffer. I am truly sorry for that. But they should take consolation in the fact that I am going out on my terms. I’ve truly given an effort. And I am currently so demoralized that I cannot mount another offensive. The Great Sleep, The Great Mercy, The Return to the Promised Land awaits. Life is a small blip in the middle of two endless expanses of nothing. That is my true state. I’m going home.

1j7m4o0,depression,i lost myself and my gf is suicidal,"Hi. I’m a 20-year-old guy, and I’ve been in a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend for two months. We’ve known each other for a year.

About a month ago, I moved from my village to the city, and since then, my mentality has completely changed. I don’t feel like myself anymore. With that change, I’ve lost all my empathy and realized that my feelings for her have faded.

My girlfriend has a difficult past marked by family abuse, severe depression, loneliness, bullying, and suicidal thoughts. Recent arguments and emotional strain have made her mentally fragile again. I wanted to support her, but instead, I panicked and froze. I couldn’t help her when she needed me most. This makes me feel weak, helpless, and disappointed in myself.

She requires a lot of emotional attention, but I’ve been overwhelmed with work and everyday responsibilities. 
Our most recent argument started because she questioned why I was emotionally responsive to my ex (who had similar struggles) but couldn’t show the same care toward her. That conversation made me realize that I’ve lost the feelings and excitement I once had for her. Unfortunately, this realization pushed her deeper into hopelessness, and she’s become suicidal again, feeling like she has nothing left to hold on to.

Now, I feel like a monster. Someone incapable of supporting a person I once loved, especially when she’s suffering. Knowing that I might be contributing to her pain is breaking me apart, and I don’t know how to handle it. I can’t just watch her spiral, but I also feel powerless to help. I need guidance. 

Please. Please, somebody help me.

Notes: 
- I summarized the situation to the bone. Feel free to ask whatever you want.
- I corrected the text with AI. I struggle a bit with english and i need more people as possible to read and understand this.
If it sounds AI-ish it's because it is. But its not a made up story. I need help. Thanks for the attention.

Tw suicidal thoughts 

I feel so useless. I am finishing high school this year and my end of school exams are coming up and I will probably not get into the uni that I want to. That feels so shitty, because I am both ugly and stupid. I never had any good experience in school, so it just feels like I absolutely wasted my time. I have been sick a lot lately (had two serious illnesses in a year) and have been sick for a month now so I just feel terrible. I have no actual friends, no person I can trust, no actual hobby or anything that I like to do, no energy left to do anything, no classmates I talk to, I don't talk to most of my family, I have no plans for future, nothing.  

The only thing I have is the feeling of guilt for not being enough and my ugly looks. 

The only reason why I haven't kms yet is because I am afraid of surviving it. I am such a coward for that. I wish I had actually done it a long time ago. 

Idk what to do, I wish I could just be free from my ugly, useless, lazy body and actually experience life fully. I actually want to experience something's but I just never could.




I actually want to have reliable friends who would be there for me. I actually want to have a good relationship with my family. I want not to have a terrible personality. I want to be pretty and be able to dress good. I want to be loved and date someone. I want to study, I actually enjoy doing it, when my body isn't slowing me down. I want to be fit. I want to not have headaches and have the time to write stories. 

But I'm just so useless that I can't. I ruined everything I did. And the chances that I didn't ruin were all ruined by my useless body.


I guess I'm just stuck like that now. I have been feeling like that for four years now and I just give up now. I wish I didn't think ""I wish had actually kms two years ago, but I am such a coward"", but I am still thinking this. I actually want to live, but the desire is so overwhelming.


Nobody is probably even going to read this and honestly idk what I even want to get out of posting this, but-

Yh..as the title says. I suffer with depression and it’s hit me harder than ever. I’m sure this group will understand the physical feeling of not wanting to be alive anymore and that’s what I’ve been feeling since yesterday. I dread waking up and I dread going to sleep because I know the day starts again. 

My mums been really hard on me and expects me to just be okay with having all the expectations and responsibilities thrown on me now that the illness going around has got her.  I said ‘I don’t think you realise how much I don’t want to be here anymore’ which she unsurprisingly responded ‘it’s funny you don’t want to be here anymore when I’m at the worst part of my bug and need you’. I just don’t understand what I did to deserve this treatment. 
I love my mum and I do SO much, always putting my own feelings aside for her. It really reminds me of when I was 13 and self harming, I had enough and finally felt safe to tell my mum..she didn’t even look at me and said ‘don’t do it again’ not an ounce of care in the way she said it. 
You’d think as someone who also has depression and knows how hard it is when you don’t want to be alive anymore she would be more concerned and caring especially when it’s her own daughter. 
I can feel myself feeling less and less willing to stay alive. I have no friends, I don’t talk to anyone apart from my mum and I suffer grately with agoraphobia on top of depression, I’m unemployed and just turned 20 and still live at home. 
I haven’t got a f!cking break in life EVER.

I don’t want to think that things will improve..I mean after everything how could I possibly delude myself with that anymore? I want to go but I’m scared.

1j7bkio,depression,My life ended when I was 21,"It ended two years ago when I had a traumatic experience after a party. Since then, I’ve had health issues and mental issues. I used to get panic attacks every night and I lived completely alone abroad with no support system and no one to check on me. I went back home, and the psychiatrists made me take 3 different antidepressants which messed up my brain.

1j73kme,depression,I feel pathetic and lost. I don’t know what to do,"I’m 15, and I feel like my life is going nowhere. I see other kids my age going out, having fun, and making memories with their friends. And me? I just sit on my phone all day, wasting time. I want to do something, to feel like I have a purpose, but I don’t have money, and I don’t know where to start. I feel like everyone else is living their life while I’m just stuck in the same place, unable to move forward.

I’ve always wanted good friends, people I can trust and have fun with, but every time I make friends, they either backstab me, use me, or turn out to be toxic. I try to be nice, but it never works out. I just end up feeling even more alone. It makes me wonder—am I the problem? Am I just unlikable? Why is it so hard for me to have genuine friendships? Sometimes, I think I’m better off without friends, but then I realize how lonely that is. I see groups of friends laughing, hanging out, enjoying their lives, and I wonder why I can’t have that. What’s wrong with me?

And school isn’t any better. I get bullied by my classmates even though I don’t do anything to them. I don’t understand why they treat me this way. I just mind my own business, yet they always find something to make fun of. But when someone bullies them, they get mad and act like they don’t deserve it. It’s so unfair. Why are people so hypocritical? It’s like no matter what I do, I’m always the one getting treated badly. No one even stands up for me. I just have to take it, pretend I don’t care, even though it eats me up inside.

My family doesn’t really care about me either. They pressure me so much when it comes to school, but they don’t actually see what I’m going through. It feels like they only care about my grades, not me as a person. Last year, I was doing well in school, but now I keep failing. It’s not because I don’t want to do well—it’s because of the environment. I feel so unmotivated. All of my classmates are so judgmental and hypocritical. You can’t even talk to them without them saying something bad about you. I can’t be myself. I always have to be on guard, watching what I say, because I know they’ll judge me for anything. It’s exhausting.

The only bright spot in my life is my girlfriend. We’re in a long-distance relationship, and she’s the only one I can truly talk to. I rant to her about my life all the time, and she listens, but I worry that I’m just burdening her with my problems. She feels like the only light in my dark world, and I don’t want to lose her. But at the same time, I feel guilty. I don’t want her to think I’m too much, that I’m too broken to be with. She deserves someone happy, someone who isn’t drowning in their own thoughts every day.

Some people give me advice, but it feels like it isn’t enough, or maybe it’s not what I’m looking for. Or maybe no advice works at all—because I don’t know. Sometimes, I wonder... I’m only 15. Why am I experiencing all of this? Am I not supposed to have fun with kids my age? But instead, here I am—so insecure, feeling like I have no purpose. I look at my future and see nothing. I don’t have any dreams, any goals, anything to look forward to. I’m just existing. And that scares me.

I try to distract myself, but nothing works. I watch videos, play games, scroll through my phone for hours, but at the end of the day, I still feel the same—empty. I see people my age being happy, having fun, living their lives, and I just feel like I’ll never have that. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Why can’t I just be normal? Why can’t I be like them? Why do I feel so different?

Sometimes, I even think about ending it all because I don’t see the point in any of this. If I disappeared, would anyone even care? Would my family even notice? Or would they just move on like I never existed? I know it’s a selfish thought, but I can’t help it. I just want the pain to stop.

I don’t know what to do anymore. Has anyone else felt this way? How did you deal with it? I could really use some advice. Because right now, I feel like I’m drowning, and no one even sees it.

I rant to her about my life all the time, and she listens, but I worry that I’m just burdening her with my problems. She feels like the only light in my dark world, and I don’t want to lose her. But at the same time, I feel guilty. I don’t want her to think I’m too much, that I’m too broken to be with. She deserves someone happy, someone who isn’t drowning in their own thoughts every day.

Some people give me advice, but it feels like it isn’t enough, or maybe it’s not what I’m looking for. Or maybe no advice works at all—because I don’t know. Sometimes, I wonder... I’m only 15. Why am I experiencing all of this? Am I not supposed to have fun with kids my age? But instead, here I am—so insecure, feeling like I have no purpose. I look at my future and see nothing. I don’t have any dreams, any goals, anything to look forward to. I’m just existing. And that scares me.

I try to distract myself, but nothing works. I watch videos, play games, scroll through my phone for hours, but at the end of the day, I still feel the same—empty. I see people my age being happy, having fun, living their lives, and I just feel like I’ll never have that. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Why can’t I just be normal? Why can’t I be like them? Why do I feel so different?

Sometimes, I even think about ending it all because I don’t see the point in any of this. If I disappeared, would anyone even care? Would my family even notice? Or would they just move on like I never existed? I know it’s a selfish thought, but I can’t help it. I just want the pain to stop.

I don’t know what to do anymore. Has anyone else felt this way? How did you deal with it? I could really use some advice. Because right now, I feel like I’m drowning, and no one even sees it.

This wasnt the first time i tried KMS, but yesterday's one was a different one, i almost lost myself. i always convince myself to hang by saying ""im just gonna try and if i feel like dying ill take it out"" always thought of kms, when i get suicidal thoughts i think of setting a camera, writing notes but when on a random night im attempting, i never do those things, don't even record.

I use strap of bag so i can choke on it, its behind my door. i pulled it, i was leaning while the strap of bag was choking my neck. then i thought of my family then pulled off the strap of bag. I didn't wanted to live i tried again, i was feeling hard to breathe, i knew if i kept it longer i wouldn't be alive then again i pulled off. Before this i had harmed myself in order to remove all the thoughts i was getting but that didnt work.

after that i was fucking sad, sad that this time again i couldnt kill myself. something's stopping me but i dont know what that thing is.

I really do not want to live. im just living for others. im not even an adult yet, below 17. First time posting here, i dont know what you call this.

1j71gwn,depression,Lost the only thing that ever made me happy in my 25 years of life and dont know how to move on now im at my lowest point in life again,"I (25M) have had multiple long relationships in my life—two lasting three years, two around three months, and the last one around two years.

I had a rough childhood, which made me unable to recognize abusive relationships. After ending all my previous relationships, I got over them quickly, even though it wasn’t easy. But I knew I wasn’t happy and didn’t receive the love I gave to my partners.

Recently, I broke up with my ex. We were together for two years. It wasn’t perfect, but I still loved her like I never loved anyone before. For the first time in my 25 years of life, I was happy.

This was her first real relationship (she's 22F), but she couldn’t get past the things she didn’t like about me or the relationship.

She had very bad retroactive jealousy.

She missed having a normal family-in-law.

She didn’t like that my sister, one of my not-so-close friends, and his girlfriend were still friends with my ex.

She felt left out of my friend group because she didn’t want to be in it due to the friend who was still in contact with my ex.

She said she loved my big heart but hated that I would do things for even non-close friends if they asked me.

She wanted me to stand up for her more when she was struggling with things—like at a birthday party where my friend’s girlfriend didn’t want to talk to her. That was also the final straw for her. She felt jealous of one of my other friends who had a friendship with that same girl while she didn’t fit into the group.


I’m not perfect by any means, but I did everything I could to make her happy.

I was a little clingy at the beginning of the relationship. I'm a very emotional person and sometimes can’t control my emotions because I’m just broken from the life I had. This made her feel like she had to comfort me during our fights, which was also something she couldn’t deal with anymore.

But I was working on my issues while in the relationship and making progress through therapy—only for her to tell me every day that she couldn’t work on any of her issues and that she should just deal with them.

The only problem I had in the relationship was that I often felt sad and like a bad partner because she felt I didn’t understand her. She thought I wasn’t comforting her when she struggled with retroactive jealousy. It broke my heart that she felt like I wasn’t there for her, even though I was. Also, seeing my partner constantly struggle with these things hurt me. She would sometimes become very cold and unloving toward me.

That part hurt me the most because I told her that’s how I grew up—in an unstable household without much love.

Even though we had our issues, we had enough good times. She was very smart and could also be very loving. I was genuinely happy when things were going well between us. I worked my ass off to get an extremely good job to buy us a house and give her the future she was used to and deserved (she grew up in a good and somewhat wealthy family, while I grew up dirt poor).

All I wanted was to spend the rest of my life with her. I hate kids, but sometimes, when she looked at me, I would think, ""Maybe having one wouldn’t be so bad""—which I never expected from myself. I also never wanted to get married, but she changed that.

After our breakup, she told me she wanted to be there for me because I’m a mess. I’ve been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts all my life. But today, she told me she couldn’t do it and wanted to have contact again in a few months because she couldn’t deal with her feelings right now.

I just don’t know how to move on with my life.

The last two years were the happiest I have ever been, and now I’ve been pushed back to the worst place I’ve ever been. All I wanted was to spend the rest of my life with this girl and do everything to give her a long, happy life together.

Since we broke up three weeks ago, I feel like I lost a part of myself, like there’s a black hole inside me. I don’t find joy in anything. I can’t even remember the past few days. I just feel like I have nothing to live for anymore.

Now my boyfriend is always willing to hang out with me but then he goes and hangs out with his friends it hits me again that outside of him and my family I don’t have anyone. I keep daydreaming of the future where I have friends and a group of ladies to go enjoy Friday nights with. But I realized I’ve been doing that since I was 14. I don’t know how to fix this because I don’t know how to develop friendships or even talk to someone enough. I just want advice from anyone that’s felt like this. ,1.0320351889975645,0.06579724708934517,Negative,High-Risk

1j6tn0m,depression,Do I have depression?,"I, (16F), have felt like I’ve been struggling with depressive symptoms ever since I was 12 years old and my parents split up- meaning I had to move back to my old house with my mum and rejoin my old school. This was worsened by the fact that it was during COVID-19 so what was already a difficult time for me became complete isolation.

In the past 6months I’ve developed an online relationship with a guy a lot older than me. The fact that he’s experienced all these things I think also contributes to my “FOMO” and belief that I’m not good enough and a waste of space. 

I keep telling myself that it might get better once I get to university and find “my people”- this is what the guy I’ve been speaking to has told me will happen- however I’m struggling to find a reason to get out of bed in the present and my anxious thoughts of wasting my life is making me want to end it all together.

Trigger warning: suicidal thoughts 

I have a rescue dog who doesn’t listen to me and only listens to my boyfriend, I only feel comfortable letting her out the cage when he’s around even though he doesn’t really watch the dog, I have a newborn and my boyfriend doesn’t understand my point with the dog and why I am scared to have her out when he’s not here. I live in a studio and she’s a big dog (pitbull lab mix)  who plays rough and growls at me when I tell her what to do and I told my boyfriend and all he says is I deserve to have her growl at me because I’m keeping her in a cage until he comes from work. 

I told him I do feel bad about the cage thing it’s just she scares me and I been super busy with baby and i have been crying a lot due to him not understanding and he sees me cry and just lets me cry and ignores me and goes to sleep. He says I should have got training for her but during that time yes I admit I should have got training for her but I was the only one working at the time and focused on buying stuff for the baby while I was pregnant because at the time I didn’t have support/family or anyone to get baby things for me or to even talk about baby things with me, I was alone in that sense. 

The dog climbs on baby stuff and tries to put paws in baby crib while she’s sleeping and I can’t have baby safely on bed because my partner insist on letting my dog on the bed and I been telling him my whole pregnancy to not let her on the bed because I want to be able to have baby on bed but he never listened. 

I asked him if he could stop calling me names like asshole and a puppet but he says I should pretty much get over it that we will say mean things to each other and should be fine since we are grown. He called me a puppet because I didn’t know what I wanted to eat the other day and says I’m a puppet in many other ways. 

It hurts me so much I spend my time crying as soon as he comes from work because he just doesn’t understand no matter how much I explain to him. I am 1 week postpartum and he has not been patient with me and not affectionate with me since leaving the hospital, he talks to his friends as soon as he leave works and get home, I asked him about it and all he says is he does it because he spent three days in the hospital with me and not socializing with friends so this is him catching up. 

He says he loves baby more than me which is fine but the fact he doesn’t even tell me he loves me since leaving the hospital makes it hurt me to hear. I truly don’t know what to do I feel so beat down, my newborn isn’t my stressor it’s him and it makes me want to break up with him or tell him I hate him cause that’s all I feel when he makes me cry this way. 

He doesn’t even help with our newborn he doesn’t even hold her cause he’s scared and feels unclean because of his job, he has made this first week so bad for me already, it feels like I am loving someone I don’t know anymore and it hurts so much he feels like a stranger. 

He is reminding me of the abusive home I grew up in with brothers and parents who treated me the same way and instead of physical he is just a men who is emotionally and mentally and verbally beating me down. I have never felt so vulnerable and weak as I do now. He wasn’t like this before baby came, he was affectionate until leaving hospital. 

This is all causing me to think about how my baby will be better off without me. ",2,0,1741424633.0,"Postpartum Postpartum ( depression & not patient partner )

I’m 19 years old and Im an extremely mentally ill and unhappy person. I’m officially diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I take Lexapro and I’m in therapy but it’s pretty inconsistent as i often have to go weeks without an appointment.

None of the medications I’ve tried have made any difference in my mood and it feels like i’m never truly happy and i’m either just content or miserable. I’ve tried committing suicide in the past multiple times and have been hospitalized. I get in these bouts of depression and when i’m in them absolutely nothing makes me feel better. I try coping in all of the ways I know how, including self harm, and my mood remains unchanged. When I get like this I have no choice but to just deal with feeling half dead for months on end.

I crave companionship and I’m in a relationship, but I’m constantly trying to push away everyone I love and ruining my relationships. It feels like I have no self control and I’m simply watching someone else take over my body. I severely hate myself and I dont know who I am. I’m extremely socially awkward, I’m very insecure, I get my feelings hurt very easily, every minor inconvenience feels like the end of the world, i feel like a failure, i feel like a waste of space. It’s so hard for me to just get up and start my day, every tiny task feels monumental. I’m absolutely terrible at dealing with stress. I have no self confidence. I feel like i’m never present in the moment and I physically can’t be because I’m always trapped in my own mind.

I just feel so emotionally numb and miserable all of the time. It’s been like this for years and it feels like nothing can make me happy. It feels like i’m actively trying to ruin my chances at happiness. I’m just so tired.

A few days ago I was trying to calm myself down, and the only thing that worked was when I thought about walking down to the river near my house and jumping in. It just put me at ease, I felt free, after hours and days of feeling absolutely trapped in my crumbling life. 

Since then I keep thinking about ways I could get hurt, or risky behaviour. I fantasize about being kidnapped or beaten by someone.

I always come back to thinking about the river, walking down there at night barefoot, submerging myself in the water slowly, fully clothed, falling asleep against the rocks there or under the bridge. 

The other night I was lying in bed at 3am, panicking. It felt like I was dying. I was nauseous and sweating. I put some clothes on, left my house, and went outside to puke on my lawn. I walked around barefoot, in the middle of the road. The cold air and pavement under my feet was good, and I kept thinking about what would happen if a car came speeding down the street at me. I ended up lying on my front lawn for over an hour. I wish I could have fallen asleep there.

I'm just so tired of worrying all the time. I hate thinking about other people. I like nighttime because it's like I'm completely alone in the world and nothing matters. 

I'm not going to kill myself. It would destroy my family and they're the best thing in my life. But I feel comforted knowing that it's an option, or a possibility.  

Does anybody else feel similar? Comforted by their suicidal thoughts?

1j64m60,depression,I believe that I am not cut out for life,"
I don't think I'm cut out for life. I don't feel like I'm fit in or in place. I am emotionally sensitive and empathetic. I don't feel like I belong. I can't find a job that pays a liveable wage. I have had a good amount of jobs for my age.  Don't have a driver license yet and I can't afford lessons right now but whats the point if I can't afford a car. Even if I work full time and make 600 a week I still wouldn't be able to afford one.

 I am in community college for accounting. I worked 30 hours a week at a pharmacy and made 400 a week still not enough. I can't afford anything and it sucks to know that this is how life is and I would have to work 3 jobs. I reduced my hours to focus on studying but now I can't afford hobbies or all of my needs and definitely not any wants. 

Right now I'm still studying but don't know how I will keep paying for college since my father is a tax evader for fafsa. I could do a payment plan but It will be all of my money. I binge eat. I don't have anyone to talk to. I have mental illnesses including depression and when I was on antidepressants I gained lots of weight and binge eating got worse so I stopped. I see a therapist and it doesn't help all they do is just suggest meds. 

My dad is dying and I never grieved my brother committing suicide. I'm lonely but a man could quickly make my life worse and more complicated. All the jobs I've been applying to virtually pay the same $12-18. I'm back to self harming. I feel like a failure and feel guilty for being alive. My parents are abusive but I don't want to have a victim complex. I still live with them and I am not able to afford to move out even with roommates. Maybe my expectations for earning is too high and my standards for life as well.

I went to beauty school to become a certified nail technician just to find that there's virtually no job openings out there for that near me at the moment. Or they are part time working 1-2 days a week. I'm considering selling press ons though but its a saturated market and I don't know who would buy from me. I have had 2 businesses ages 16-20 that flopped. Multiple hobbies that flopped and there is absolutely nothing that I am passionate about or enjoy. I don't enjoy entertainment either.

I'm not sure what to do with my life and how to feel better and I have been forcing myself for the past few weeks to forget every single thing and move forward but I genuinely do not see much to be happy about.

When I confided in my friend she said I'm privileged and my life is not that bad and they have it worse. I'm not doubting others have it worse at all. What prompted me to write this post is while searching for a new job because my current one I am very underpaid and staff is toxic and I am sick of abuse from the customers, I realized I still can barely find anything that would allow me to live that I got overwhelmed and cried and my mother said that I need to grow up and asked me how am I going to manage to survive which is true, and I don't think I will to be honest. She also said that me crying causes her stress and said that the stress I cause her and my dad is what turns them to drink. She says I make excuses which I think is true in some cases. I have been dissocoating for the past 6 years and every second every minute every week every month and every year passes by me in seconds. I will wake up one day and be 50 if i make it to then wondering where all the time has gone. 

I think the people in my life think I am weak which is true. I'm not even trying to seek pity or be self pity or a victim but I just don't see the point. I am not a victim it is all my fault and I believe any abuse that I have endured I must of have deserved it. I just get easily overwhelmed and I don't know why and I am immature. 

I don't know what to do with my life and I need someone to tell me.

I have attempted a least a dozen times, somehow I tend to always stop myself last minute. I’ve overdosed then made myself vomit and went to hospital. I’ve hung myself but never from a high enough spot where I wouldn’t be able to undo it. All kinds of methods, but I somehow always end up only putting in 50-75% effort into actually going through with it. I’ve been 51/50’d at least 20 times but never “court ordered”. Usually in and out within a weeks span. I’ve tried a plethora of medications. I’m diagnosed clinically depressed as well as schizoaffective. I can’t keep a job longer than 3 months without having a breakdown or episode at work causing me to lose my job. I’m now unemployed again and living with my younger brother. I don’t have a car, no money. I’ve ruined my finance horribly… sure I can go out and get another job but in my heart I know what will happen… I’m sure I could get approved for SSI, but I can’t sit around for 2years or more waiting for a decision.

Started eating clean (wasn't easy in a junk food household, but I managed), gym 5-6 days a week, started a skincare routine, talked to strangers more on purpose, gained a good amount of weight (8kg) (no longer a broom stick with the strength of a toddler), started journaling on the regular, started reading books, learned how to play guitar, took art more seriously, took my education a lot more seriously, decorated my room to what I see fits, learned how to cook, deleted all social media accounts (except for reddit and whatssap. I very rarely use reddit), I barely touch my phone anymore, and changed my fashion to fit me more. In addition, I did all the research on my own with no support or guidance from my parents (they couldn't care less, actually the opposite, would get annoyed whenever I cook myself a homecooked meal when they bring take out). 

  
I did everything right, and all on my own. I should be happy, but I still wake up and go to bed feeling like shit everyday no matter my accomplishments that day. I am still passively suicidal everydarnday. I am actively looking for a drug (not naming) that's available over the counter, take more than 130mg and it can grant you an euphoric feeling. I genuinely think that's my last resort to any ounce of happiness. Doesn't help I'm belittled everyday by people who are uneducated. For example, as I said I was incredibly weak my whole life, I could barely do 10 \*wall\* pushups. I started strength training at 18, stayed consistent, counted every calorie, dragged my ass to gym on days I felt dying was a better option, now a year later today, I did my first ever full pushup with great form. I believed all  my life I would never be able to do that, I was so happy (first time in a while) that I recorded it again and proudly showed it to my biological father. All I got was the standard ""okay?....."" response, he said pushups are easier for women, because there's less weight we need to push (I'm 57.6 kg), and that he didn't know knee-pushups are a thing, they are useless, and that everyone should already be able to do full pushups, man or woman, with no training. Then got his obese ass up and did 10 full pushups (he doesn't work out, only during his teen years) and essentially laughed at my face. I went to my room crying. (this happens frequently).

     I don’t really believe that I’ll make it through my life without ending it. Makes me feel at least a little in control. I know it’s just trauma. I work hard to fix it. Fucking Hard!

Maybe it’s a therapist that has to give up their life to show me any of it fucking matters. Do you really care that much about sad people like us?? I don’t think it’s worth it if you have half a brain. Go live your life! 
    How can I say this more clearly?? We don’t matter.       We are a drain on the system (even if we are a symptom). We don’t matter, as long as we exist.

 There is nothing more I desire than to stop being a burden to those around me. Wining is my vice. I don’t deserve life. Yet the only reason I don’t end it is to not create pain in the lives of those I love…what a fitting end for one who hate their existence. 

    None who are close to me know I share these thoughts. Shame! For shame I am silent. For shame, I will remain anonymous.

1j5mjpx,depression,"Calmly, comfortably, wishing I didn’t live anymore","Life has become so hard that I genuinely just don’t want to be here anymore. I’ve rationalized it, it makes logical sense. The pain and suffering have become so bad, any hope I had or desire to continue is just gone. 

It started my time as a firefighter for three years. Then my time in the army. My PTSD from what I experience gave me bad anxiety and depression. I’ve tried fighting it for years. Then in 2020 I got out. I thought my life as a civilian would be better. But it was tough. The transition didn’t go well, and worse, I started dating someone who would be downfall. She had borderline personality disorder. I would never wish this on anyone but she stopped going to therapy. She stopped taking her meds and kept drinking instead. 

The relationship became extremely toxic. Her mental episodes and suicidal ideations became worse. I had to wrestle a knife from her a few times and pick her up from a mental hospital. I couldn’t save her. She became emotionally abusive, exploitative. I spent over $50,000 over three years trying to help her. She never even tried to pay me back after many promises. Even after graduating college in 2022 she struggled to keep a job. I picked her up from the police to help her get out of her first DUI. I paid for her mother’s rent when times were tough. I rushed her to the hospital when she needed it but, months later when I needed to go to the emergency room she refused and left me to go to a tattoo appointment. It was horrible manipulation and abuse I didn’t realize at the time because I was walking on eggshells and trying my best to make the relationship work. But eventually she committed VA disability fraud to get a pension and then she cheated on me and left. She stole my social security number, she gave me herpes. I was broke. Rebuilding my life. I thought things would get better. 

After receiving messages from an emergency text on my iPhone (I was still her emergency POC) that she was in a car accident at 2:30am. She had crashed twice in 6 months from DUIs. I reached out to try and help. She said she was lonely. But when we met she used the opportunity to humiliate me and hurt me. I told her I still loved her and if she was dating anyone, to let me know so that I would stay away. But she actually was sleeping with multiple people each weekend. She went into explicit detail to make me jealous and hurt me. I became mad. I started yelling. I got out of her car and left. She used a few text messages saying I was reporting her to the police for fraud, out of context, to get a restraining order against me. I never physically hurt her and I never would have. 

Now, I lost my security clearance, my gun rights, I might lose my job. She cheated on me, stole from me, humiliated me and beat me down over years. I feel gutted. Empty. I feel like a loser. I feel like the world no longer cares about me, my voice, my facts. I was abused and taken advantage of by someone I just wanted to love and have her love me back. The past few months of dating is leading to nowhere. No one wants to date me.

I’m 32. Working a job I hate. Alone. Unwanted. I have a restraining order my record. I’m not needed by anyone. And I just don’t see any reason anymore to continue being in so much pain with no hope.

Been a Reddit lurker for about 15 years I have never posted. For reference I’m 28 male  6”3 a solid 235-250 depending on the day. (I know that’s a gauge people use  so I figured I’d add it) Not even sure how to get to the right audience. Anywhere here I go….


I don’t even know where to start. I’m lost and feel like a failure no matter what I do. Utter worthlessness. I try to pride myself in being self aware of my feelings but I’m at an impasse I guess. 

Here is some background on my current life. I have an absolutely amazing wife. We have a baby girl under two and another one on the way. I love being a dad and a great husband. Bought a cheap basket case of a house before the market boom and refinanced with a great Covid rate. Been doing a great job fixing it up. In short my living situation is for now…ideal.  I’m in central NJ making roughly 100k a year with my wife being a. SAHM. I’m blessed to be able to afford it but it’s not without sacrifice. 

More background…. I had a horrific upbringing that I don’t dwell on and to vaguely speak about it in a social media post is extremely out of character. I grew up poverty line with a very physically abusive father & uncle with an equally emotional abusive mother. Father tragically was murdered when I was thirteen. We were homeless for quite some time. I’ve been in my own since about that time. 

Now to the nitty gritty. I legit am never happy anymore. Thanks to my own hard work and dedication to creating a stress free life I can’t enjoy it. I legitimately don’t feel an ounce of happiness in what seems like my entire life. My wife? Amazing. My kid is great. I’m the first person in my whole family (I talk to non of them) to be financially stable. 
I’m constantly stressed. “Waiting for the other shoe to drop” it hasn’t because I put up a great facade but my greatest fear is it effecting my wife or kids mental health. 

To cope I’ve tried it all. Therapy didn’t work and I gave it an honest shot with 3 different therapist over the course is about 2 years. I can’t smoke bud as I’ve been suggested by a ton of people. I’ve tried all different ways over the years and I “green out” or have these crazy schizophrenic? Episodes. NOT an option. I really dislike alcohol but god damn does that do the trick for a short period of time. I have a few drinks I feel happiness with what I wish I felt all the time. I know it’s wrong but I don’t know what to do anymore. 

My baby girl, wife and child on the way need me but I can’t stop fantasizing about ending it all. I would never because of my obligations to my family. I’m just what I call “vibrating” with the sensation of my blood itching at all times. I just want it to stop. I’ve heard stories about alcoholics and I don’t think I’m there. It the only thing that helps but I really hate the hangovers and regret after drinking. I’ve weight lifted for the better part of a decade but can’t even bring myself to do it anymore. 

I don’t know anymore. I’ve never had anti depressants and to be honest I don’t want a crutch at all I just want to be normal. I fantasize about being drunk to feel normal all day but Seldom ever do since I dislike the taste and after effects. Maybe once a month tops have a few drink and once every 3+ months drunkish. 

I’m out of ideas. But it’s coming to a head for awhile. I need relief or I’m afraid I will do something extreme to feel relief.

1j5fd0z,depression,he wanted to help by being harsh,"so i have an ex/friend/weird thing with this guy that has left us in contact every now and then and everytime we are in contact we update each other on our lives etc

we met in 12th grade im now 22, all this time ive been a mess with my depression and suicidality that i kinda vent out to him trying to get someones support or a kind word and it used to be okay til the last couple of times and espacially yesterday

he said 'if i were you i would make up my mind if i wanted to live or not then either build up the courage to live or build up the courage to end my life' aafter i had vented to him about how i cant see the light out here and feel like i shouldve been dead long ago.'

i said i wish things would change but they dont and he said so end it its better than complicating stuff more, mind u i was crying so hard at this moment i was so ready to do it, it felt so right he was so right

1j5ebfc,depression,I’m stuck.,"I have had a rough couple of years with my mental health. Every day it’s a gamble with what I’m going to be like mentally. Some days are great and no matter how hard I try to hold on it still slips away. I constantly feel like a failure even though my boyfriend reassures me I’m not. I hated living at home for so long (I’m 24 now, lived at home since I was 23) so we decided to move someplace we both loved. We did it and I do love it here but I’m also alone, no friends, no family close by. That doesn’t affect me as much as the simple fact that I cannot keep feeling this way. 

I have thought about ending it multiple times but I know that would just be giving into it and I try to think I’m stronger than that. It’s just gotten so hard to keep going. I do work in a commission based industry and I’m still pretty new to it so that is a major factor as well. I am good at it I just haven’t been given the opportunity to show people what I can do. Which I blame myself for every single day. Due to my current work situation, I can’t do the things that I usually like to do which has taken its toll. 

I want to give up every single day. I can’t get out of bed In the morning. I want to be able to wake up and go to the gym or do something other than sleep in but it’s like I physically can’t. Does anyone else feel like they physically can’t do things because of their mind? I try to force myself but it overtakes me always. It’s like I’m fighting a losing battle with myself every day and I hate it. I hate myself for being this way. I know it won’t be fixed overnight and time is the only thing that can help. But I’ve felt this way for a while now and I’m scared I’m going to finally break. I’ve tried therapy but it’s far too expensive for me right now and it didn’t really help. 

I’m tired of feeling like a failure and a disappointment to myself. Does anyone else feel this way? How to I figure out how to deal with it? ",3,2,1741318492.0,"I’m stuck.

I'm done man ive had enough, when I ask whats the point of all this suffering people just say ""you make your own meaning in life"" I did, I really did make a meaning for my life, and I lost it, that thing I had no longer brings me joy it only brings me pain and hatred for this world. So what now? I no longer have a meaning to suffer I have no point for this shit living is unbearable, every second and every heartbeat feels painful, the only moments I dont want to die is when Im distracted with video games or YouTube videos. 

But then what, tomorrow I have 3 exams and I didnt study for any of them, because I cant go one second without being distracted that I'll start getting suicidal, its my last year of high school, im supposed to be studying hours a day to get into college, if I want a good future i need to work this year, I know it but so what? I dont want a future, no matter how successful I can become I'll still be in pain, I will always work a job I dont care for just to pay bills for purchases I dont care for. Whats the point? I no longer have one, theres no finishing line and the path isnt good enough to justify the pain.

 I always get told that I should be grateful that I'm not as miserable as other people and I never understood that, there are people who suffer more than me and I'm meant to be happy about it? Am I weird for refusing to accept any positive emotions that come from the information that other people are miserable? Knowing how much this world sucks only makes me want to not live in it Im not glad or grateful that I didnt have the worst life as much as I feel horrible to know someone else did.  I feel alone, like no one can understand me, no matter bow much pain people around me have they never consider suicide, thats just not an option for them, but for me it always has been, I cant go one day without thinking of how much I want to die. Am I crazy? How can other people bare this godforsaken world and accept this shitty reality, how can people live happily knowing about the sufferings of others, knowing that no matter how much you try to help them there will always be things you can't do to help people, knowing that suffering is just a constant in this world and that it nothing of it matters.

 I simply cant take it anymore, people dont need a reason to live they just need a reason to keep suffering, I no longer have a reason, and every time I think about what I lost my body goes numb and I almost collapse, and now all I have is the reality of how ugly it is, and I cant anymore, the pain of loosing the only thing that gave my life joy is unbearable yet I cant cry, I cant stop, I dont have time for that cause I'm meant to be working and studying, and this is making me go insane, I dont have time to cope or care, I only have time to suffer, and when I think about the future I realize that its all for nothing, that the only thing I can guarantee is my own suffering, my own agony, so why oh why should I live? They say there are things so good that make life worth living, but shouldnt the opposite be true as well? Shouldn't there be experiences so vile that justify suicide?

1j53hlr,depression,My Story | March/6/2025,"Hi,

So I have been writing lately, I also added parts/point to my Doctor to better understand me and respond to my requests, I know it is long, but it is a series of writing throughout the past 6 months. 

I just wanted to share it... Maybe one day in the future, people will read my story xD

\---

**Personal Mental Health/Depression History \*****^(Public)**

**Childhood and Early Life (Up to Age 12)**

I had a **normal childhood** until age 12, but in **fifth grade**, I developed a **fear of school** due to teachers **physically punishing students** who didn’t complete their homework. This fear lasted until my mother intervened, and I was able to return to school normally.

I struggled in school, excelling only in memorization, but even that was difficult. My mind constantly wandered, making it hard to keep up.

Outside of school, I saw my grandmother having what I now believe was a seizure, but as a child, I didn’t realize what was happening and walked away. Minutes later, I heard the maid scream, “She’s not moving!” My father tried to wake her, but she never did, and later the **Paramedics** came. She passed away at the hospital. That moment left me with **deep guilt and became my first experience with trauma**.

**Onset of Depression (Ages 13-14) (Episode Zero - The Sad Face)**

At **13-14 years old**, I experienced my **first episode of depression**. I felt **sad every day at school**, and things worsened when my **older brother switched to home-schooling**, leaving me to attend alone. My **father suggested I switch as well**, which I did, hoping it would help.

During this time, I **withdrew socially**, stayed home, and **avoided friends**. My family noticed my sadness, and it became part of my expression—**the ""sad face"" I have**. I also had **persistent negative thoughts**, but I couldn’t understand or explain them. Later, my brother and I switched to **private night schooling** to improve our grades.

**Temporary Improvement and Adolescence (Ages 15-19)**

At age 15, during a trip with relatives and friends my age, the sadness suddenly lifted, and I felt normal again. My family noticed the positive change (I thought my sadness of the previous 2 years was due to growing up). However, between the ages of 16-19 when I switched to normal schooling, I started experiencing alternating phases of:

1. **Depressive episodes** with sadness and social withdrawal (Sometimes social fear).
2. **Periods of high productivity and motivation,** during which I was socially active, and I would learn new things (e.g., programming) but stop after a few weeks, often feeling drained or losing interest.
3. I was **still bad** at **school**, I only passed with high grades because it was a private school and I used to not attend school, only few days a month!**…**

The cycles of depression were unpredictable and left me feeling emotionally unstable. During this time, my main **coping mechanism** was playing **video games** or watching **TV shows.** These activities helped distract me and provided temporary relief but weren’t effective later during my *major* depressive episodes, particularly during intense ones.

**Post-High School Challenges (Ages 19-24)**

1. After graduating high school, I spent **one year at home** due to not being accepted into university because my grades in the entry exams were low, which caused frustration and sadness. 
2. When I finally joined university, majoring in English, which was my interest since I was young, and the only subject I am good at. My **first year** was exciting; I was actively involved in group projects and studies, and made new friends and was socially active where I go with them every day. I was also getting A’s because I was telling myself if I don’t do so, I’ll be a failure all my life, which gave me a high motivation, but really a stressful night of studying.
3. In my **second year,** I started isolating myself socially, interacting with peers & friends only when necessary. This isolation continued throughout university years.
4. My **final year** was marked by depression, shared among many peers, driven by fears of an uncertain future. After graduating, I spent **eight months at home job-searching** and battling depression.

**First Job and Transition to a Toxic Role (Age 24)**

**First Job: Excitement and Growth**

Eight months after graduating, I got my first and best job as a Customer Service Associate at Amazon. It was fulfilling, and I felt excited to build my career. I connected well with my colleagues who were also new to the job, and I started settling into the work environment and made new friends that I would call best friends and was telling my self I am finally going to settle but it didn’t last.

After two months, I got **higher-paying job offers, including one in the military. It was a stressful decision, but I left.**

**Toxic Job: Hospital Role**

I decided to leave my first job for a civilian position at a well-known hospital *temporarily* as I wait for final confirmation at a different job. Initially I was expected to work in **ER reception** but was instead assigned a **physically demanding supply role**. My **transfer requests were denied**, and the job became **too exhausting**, leading me to resign without another job lined up.

**Major Panic/Depressive Episodes 2023/2024**

**First Episode (Toxic Job – Early 2023, Age 24)**                                                          

This occurred during my time at the toxic job in early 2023. The physically demanding nature of the role, a toxic environment, combined with feelings of being trapped in a position I didn’t sign up for, caused severe exhaustion and mental strain. I felt overwhelmed, helpless, and unmotivated. I struggled to advocate for myself when my requests for a transfer to my actual role were denied. This inability to speak up left me feeling even more powerless, amplifying my distress. This depressive episode **marked** my **first experience** with **intense feelings of sadness**, **disappointments,** and **despair**. My only way of coping was voice-recording as I drove home each night, where I used to vent out about my issues.

**Relief and Relapse After Toxic Job**

After quitting, I felt euphoric for two months—enjoying freedom, hobbies, and learning. But soon, fear of the future returned, leading to a relapse.

**Second Episode (Uncle's Betrayal –  March/April 2023, Age 24)**

This episode began a couple of months after leaving the toxic hospital job, in the lead-up to **April 2023**. It was triggered by my **uncle's betrayal**, where I helped him by loaning him a rented car in good faith under my name, to which he later refused to return it. He repeatedly lied about returning the car, delayed addressing the fines he accrued, and ignored my requests. The combination of **betrayal**, **financial stress**, and **preparing for my upcoming job** with medical tests by trying to lose weight, caused me to experience one of the **worst depressive episodes of my life**. It lasted for two months with severe sadness (leading to crying for the first time in a decade) and feelings of severe hopelessness.

**Third Episode (New beginning & Department Transfer – May to December 2023, Age 25)**

I was able to get the car back from my uncle and at the same time I started my current job at the University, which was in **May 2023,** feeling relieved, excited, and motivated. For the 1^(st) three months, I worked with full energy and was actively engaged in my role. My efforts were noticed, and I felt a sense of purpose and accomplishment, and thought things were getting **settled** in my life. **However**, as time passed, I began to feel drained. My energy levels dropped, and my colleagues started pointing out that I looked exhausted and needed to take time off or take better care of myself.

In **November 2023,** and with me being drained, I was unexpectedly **told to temporarily transfer** to another department due to staff shortages. Although I felt the transfer was **unfair and beyond my capacity**, I couldn’t bring myself to object (say no) or discuss my concerns with my manager. The new role required me to work alone in a **highly stressful environment** with little support or training. The *sudden change* and *increased pressure* **triggered** a **panic attack**—though I didn’t recognize it as such at the time. I also began experiencing **severe anxiety** and for the first time in my life I had **wishes of death, imagining myself being dead** or even **choking myself for relief**.

Luckily for the first time, I sought help at the ***employee clinic*** around **December 2023**, I was asked so many questions and one of them was if my depression and stress were related to work. At that moment, I didn’t connect the two and said no, not realizing the link because I wanted fast help. This depressive episode lasted about **one month,** in which it prompted me to go to the clinic and start medication for the first time, leading to a series of medications.                              

**Fourth / Later Episode (Promotion Delay – November 2024, Age 26)**            

The fourth episode occurred **briefly** in **November 2024** when I was **promised** a promotion, only to have it delayed unexpectedly. Although it was a **shorter depressive episode**, lasting only about **one week**, I felt deeply **disappointed**, **frustrated**, and **hopeless**. I wanted to **express my dissatisfaction** to my manager but felt overwhelmed by the idea, which **stopped me from speaking up**. Being on medication at the time helped reduce the severity of the symptoms and accepting it as is, but it **led to losing purpose** in **career** and **life**! >>> I was able to speak to him in December 2024 about my disappointment of the delay, which relieved me a bit.

**Key Observations and Patterns**

**Age 27, Male**

**Family History:**

My **father** has **bipolar disorder (I have his report file with medications),** also one of my uncles has **psychosis.** I was told by my father that these conditions and mental conditions ranging from bipolar, psychosis, and adhd are **common** in **our family branch**. I was recently told that even my grandfather had bipolar, which explains a lot. Also, my father is pointing out that some of my brothers have symptoms.

1. **Mood Cycles:**
   * I alternate between:
      * **Depressive phases:** Sadness, social withdrawal, lack of motivation, and ~~suicidal ideation~~.
      * **Periods of energy (rare) & motivation:** Social confidence, high productivity (learning new things & starting new projects), and **impulsiveness** which is noticed after using Wellbutrin.
2. **Triggers:**
   * Stressful life events (e.g., toxic jobs, betrayals) often precede depressive episodes. (sometimes random)
   * All my major depressive episodes were caused by a reason, and all were in the year 2023, but before that, when I was 13-14, my depression came out of nowhere and I consider it a major one.
3. **Physical Symptoms:**
   * **Sleep issues** like oversleeping during depression / reduced sleep or staying up late during high-energy phases \[maybe personality trait or bad habit?\].
   * **Physical agitation:** (e.g., leg shaking, hand tremors and maybe Myoclonus?) It is linked to **Wellbutrin** because after reducing the dose it went away and then increasing the dose it came back.
   * **Forgetfulness:** It started after the new medications for mood stabilization.

**4.      Coping Mechanisms:**

o   *In the* ***past****, I* ***coped*** *with overwhelming emotions by* ***sleeping****,* ***playing video games****,* ***watching shows, and*** ***eating large meals (****led to overweight****)****. These provided temporary distraction but didn’t address the core of my struggles.*

o   *Since starting medications, my* ***coping*** ***has shifted****. Now, I find myself beside watching shows, I started* ***reading*** *about depression,* ***writing****, or sometimes unwillingly getting* ***low*** ***sad emotion****, which occasionally provides relief. However, these methods often feel like distractions rather than solutions, and the sadness or pressure in my chest tends to linger or return.*

***5.      Suicidal Phase:***

o   *I need to be honest, at one point when I was taking Prozac 40mg, my emotions were bland and at that time I secretly was suicidal, where I almost overdosed on my medications, I had them right in my hand and something is telling me DO IT! TAKE IT! I was so tempted to take it! Not only that, I was also searching for a peaceful way to die, but each time at the end I stop.*

o   *Currently I am not suicidal but looking back, I ask myself what made me be like that?*

**Medication Journey (Update as of March 2025)**

Diagnosed with Bipolar II by online psychiatrist, although I was told by the hospital it needs an assessment (currently on the waiting list).

·       **Prozac 20mg (Start: December 2023) – Employee Clinic / Resident/Consultation with** a psychiatrist I consulted

When I first started Prozac, it released my locked emotions, where my emotions were filed in a jar trying to escape, and the jar was pressurized from the locked emotions in it. Prozac came and opened the jar, releasing all my emotions, but in return, it didn’t leave any for me to live with, and it made my life bland and empty.

·        **Prozac 40 mg: (Around July 2024?)** Employee Clinic / a psychiatrist I consulted

It briefly relieved my emotions, but after two weeks, it triggered suicidal thoughts. I believe this was due to increased emotional numbness and lack of joy.

·        **Prozac 60 mg (October 2024):** Employee Clinic / Resident with consultation to a psychiatrist I consulted.

It was similar to the effect of 40mg and caused temporary sadness (only 1 week) and afterward emptiness. Currently I am at 20mg.

·       **Wellbutrin (Started Late October 2024) – Prescribed by a Psychiatry Consultant (A) –** 

Wellbutrin gave me the boost I wanted, similar to drinking an energy drink. It made me energized, but I was reckless when I was energized. I made big-time decisions fast. People like to call it a hypomania phase. Although Wellbutrin helped me with my low energy, but what is the point of energy if you have no desire in life? It caused severe side effects. I was told to lower the dose to taper off Wellbutrin, but doing so made my energy and motivation drop significantly. I thought I should at least take 75mg in the morning and 75mg at night, but I don’t think it did much in the long run. I was later unmotivated and had low energy, so I upped the dose based on the recommendation of a psychiatrist. I feel like I’m back to better now.

·       **Quetiapine (Started December 2024) – Prescribed by Psychiatry Consultant (B) –** 

Quetiapine helped me during sleep, but a higher dose was too much for me; it made my mornings sluggish. I started with 25mg before bedtime and increased till 100mg, but it made me extremely tired the next morning. I found that 25-50mg is the best dose for now, and I was told it’s okay to stay on it.

·       **Lamictal 25mg to 300mg (Started December 2024) – Prescribed by Psychiatry Consultant (B) –** 

It made me feel like my normal self again. I feel like Lamictal made my mood more stable but only stable, not higher or better. It was prescribed to stabilize my mood due to concerns about bipolar tendencies. a psychiatrist I consulted later told me to increase weekly by 50mg until I reached 300mg, which is considered the therapeutic dose. I currently take 300mg (2 pills in the morning and 1 at night). I feel like it made me feel back to myself, but gave me forgetfulness of short-term memory, I think.

·       **Aripiprazole (Started January 9, 2025) – Prescribed by a Consultant (C) -** 

Initially prescribed at 5mg after confirmation of Bipolar II tendencies, which overwhelmed me with sadness. I was later told to increase it to 7.5mg and then 10mg, but I stopped after experiencing severe restlessness where I needed to move a lot. It got to a point where I went to the clinic for help, but they didn’t do much. An online psychiatrist later told me to stop the medication. I am currently taking 2.5mg to taper off.

·       **Propranolol 40mg (PRN) – Prescribed to Manage Restlessness and Hand Jitter**

Propranolol helped with the jitteriness caused by Wellbutrin and with something I always used to have, which is a high heart rate. I was told to take it daily to help with the restlessness and hand jittering caused by Wellbutrin.

***Note*** *that I am currently feeling like each medication has helped in certain parts, but some parts aren’t fixed.*

***In short\* Prozac*** *only removed the pressure in my heart I used to have and released my emotions,* ***Wellbutrin*** *helped with energy,* **Quetiapine** helped with sleep, ***Lamictal*** *made my mood more stable,* ***propranolol*** *helped with side effects, for* ***Aripiprazole*** *I don’t know if it helped or not*

**Current Concerns**:

·        Severe restlessness when on Aripiprazole 7.5mg+, to the point it affected me at work since I work in an office. I was told to **stop the medication**, currently at 2.5mg, and **low restlessness.**

·        I **can’t** stay focused on boring tasks; I just stop and lose myself in thoughts. This has always been an issue, even before medications.

·        I lost my ability to pay attention to details

·        I **feel tired** each morning. I think it is because I sometimes stay late.

·        I **feel** like I am **stable**, but sometimes a **sudden mood shift** happens that lasts until the next day, and I can’t understand why. I am also trying to treat my lack of pleasure (**anhedonia**) and to treat severe sudden boredom.

·        I think I am having anxiety in terms of mental health and trying to treat myself out of anxiety.

I am currently also trying to treat other parts of my mental health, **see the following traits that have affected me all my life**, some are more of my personality:

·        In my childhood, I’ve always had trouble staying focused in class or on boring tasks, dealing with boredom, looking for more stimulants like playing, and following through on things. Although I sometimes have this thing where I might look like I am focused or distracted on something, I am actually listening to whatever people are talking about behind me and at the same time looking at the thing I am focused on.

·        I procrastinate a lot where I start things but never finish them. I recently started my second degree in CS, invested money in it, because it was my dream, but later I lost interest and motivation, I later postponed. I also sometimes start projects but lose interest later even though it was exciting at first.

·        I have future and past conversations in my head all the time, and sometimes it gives me a headache. I jump from one thought to another, or sometimes I have too many thoughts at once. This has always been an issue, and I feel like it affected my life, and I am not sure if it is normal or not.

·        I forget things a lot, I put something on a table, and moments later, I don’t remember where I placed it. I was told this isn’t related to Wellbutrin.

·        I have a spending problem, I tend to make fast decisions, sometimes regret them later, but I feel like that’s just my personality.

·        I struggle to stay engaged in anything that isn’t stimulating. Even when I start something important, I later stop because I lose motivation. Although when I have an incentive thing, I stay on it because in my mind it is either I finish whatever is in front of me or things will get worse for me and this how it got me through college, either get A’s or I’ll be a failure the rest of my life which gave anxiety back then.

·        I have this comprehension problem where I write words, my head fills the gap and I jump to the next word, forgetting that I didn’t write the word I was thinking about. Even when reading something I wrote, I see words that aren’t there or forgot to add them. It was much noticeable during my college years.

*My main struggles currently are the lack of joy,* ***motivation****,* ***commitments,*** *alongside unpredictable mood shifts,* ***mostly depressive episodes or severe boredom – (currently stable)***

*I am seeking a* ***treatment plan*** *that helps me stabilize and find balance in my life.*                          ",1,1,1741288544.0,"My Story | March/6/2025 Hi,

So I have been writing lately, I also added parts/point to my Doctor to better understand me and respond to my requests, I know it is long, but it is a series of writing throughout the past 6 months. 

I just wanted to share it... Maybe one day in the future, people will read my story xD

\---

**Personal Mental Health/Depression History \*****^(Public)**

**Childhood and Early Life (Up to Age 12)**

I had a **normal childhood** until age 12, but in **fifth grade**, I developed a **fear of school** due to teachers **physically punishing students** who didn’t complete their homework. This fear lasted until my mother intervened, and I was able to return to school normally.

I struggled in school, excelling only in memorization, but even that was difficult. My mind constantly wandered, making it hard to keep up.

Outside of school, I saw my grandmother having what I now believe was a seizure, but as a child, I didn’t realize what was happening and walked away. Minutes later, I heard the maid scream, “She’s not moving!” My father tried to wake her, but she never did, and later the **Paramedics** came. She passed away at the hospital. That moment left me with **deep guilt and became my first experience with trauma**.

**Onset of Depression (Ages 13-14) (Episode Zero - The Sad Face)**

At **13-14 years old**, I experienced my **first episode of depression**. I felt **sad every day at school**, and things worsened when my **older brother switched to home-schooling**, leaving me to attend alone. My **father suggested I switch as well**, which I did, hoping it would help.

During this time, I **withdrew socially**, stayed home, and **avoided friends**. My family noticed my sadness, and it became part of my expression—**the ""sad face"" I have**. I also had **persistent negative thoughts**, but I couldn’t understand or explain them. Later, my brother and I switched to **private night schooling** to improve our grades.

**Temporary Improvement and Adolescence (Ages 15-19)**

At age 15, during a trip with relatives and friends my age, the sadness suddenly lifted, and I felt normal again. My family noticed the positive change (I thought my sadness of the previous 2 years was due to growing up). However, between the ages of 16-19 when I switched to normal schooling, I started experiencing alternating phases of:

1. **Depressive episodes** with sadness and social withdrawal (Sometimes social fear).
2. **Periods of high productivity and motivation,** during which I was socially active, and I would learn new things (e.g., programming) but stop after a few weeks, often feeling drained or losing interest.
3. I was **still bad** at **school**, I only passed with high grades because it was a private school and I used to not attend school, only few days a month!**…**

The cycles of depression were unpredictable and left me feeling emotionally unstable. During this time, my main **coping mechanism** was playing **video games** or watching **TV shows.** These activities helped distract me and provided temporary relief but weren’t effective later during my *major* depressive episodes, particularly during intense ones.

**Post-High School Challenges (Ages 19-24)**

1. After graduating high school, I spent **one year at home** due to not being accepted into university because my grades in the entry exams were low, which caused frustration and sadness. 
2. When I finally joined university, majoring in English, which was my interest since I was young, and the only subject I am good at. My **first year** was exciting; I was actively involved in group projects and studies, and made new friends and was socially active where I go with them every day. I was also getting A’s because I was telling myself if I don’t do so, I’ll be a failure all my life, which gave me a high motivation, but really a stressful night of studying.
3. In my **second year,** I started isolating myself socially, interacting with peers & friends only when necessary. This isolation continued throughout university years.
4. My **final year** was marked by depression, shared among many peers, driven by fears of an uncertain future. After graduating, I spent **eight months at home job-searching** and battling depression.

**First Job and Transition to a Toxic Role (Age 24)**

**First Job: Excitement and Growth**

Eight months after graduating, I got my first and best job as a Customer Service Associate at Amazon. It was fulfilling, and I felt excited to build my career. I connected well with my colleagues who were also new to the job, and I started settling into the work environment and made new friends that I would call best friends and was telling my self I am finally going to settle but it didn’t last.

After two months, I got **higher-paying job offers, including one in the military. It was a stressful decision, but I left.**

**Toxic Job: Hospital Role**

I decided to leave my first job for a civilian position at a well-known hospital *temporarily* as I wait for final confirmation at a different job. Initially I was expected to work in **ER reception** but was instead assigned a **physically demanding supply role**. My **transfer requests were denied**, and the job became **too exhausting**, leading me to resign without another job lined up.

**Major Panic/Depressive Episodes 2023/2024**

**First Episode (Toxic Job – Early 2023, Age 24)**                                                          

This occurred during my time at the toxic job in early 2023. The physically demanding nature of the role, a toxic environment, combined with feelings of being trapped in a position I didn’t sign up for, caused severe exhaustion and mental strain. I felt overwhelmed, helpless, and unmotivated. I struggled to advocate for myself when my requests for a transfer to my actual role were denied. This inability to speak up left me feeling even more powerless, amplifying my distress. This depressive episode **marked** my **first experience** with **intense feelings of sadness**, **disappointments,** and **despair**. My only way of coping was voice-recording as I drove home each night, where I used to vent out about my issues.

**Relief and Relapse After Toxic Job**

After quitting, I felt euphoric for two months—enjoying freedom, hobbies, and learning. But soon, fear of the future returned, leading to a relapse.

**Second Episode (Uncle's Betrayal –  March/April 2023, Age 24)**

This episode began a couple of months after leaving the toxic hospital job, in the lead-up to **April 2023**. It was triggered by my **uncle's betrayal**, where I helped him by loaning him a rented car in good faith under my name, to which he later refused to return it. He repeatedly lied about returning the car, delayed addressing the fines he accrued, and ignored my requests. The combination of **betrayal**, **financial stress**, and **preparing for my upcoming job** with medical tests by trying to lose weight, caused me to experience one of the **worst depressive episodes of my life**. It lasted for two months with severe sadness (leading to crying for the first time in a decade) and feelings of severe hopelessness.

**Third Episode (New beginning & Department Transfer – May to December 2023, Age 25)**

I was able to get the car back from my uncle and at the same time I started my current job at the University, which was in **May 2023,** feeling relieved, excited, and motivated. For the 1^(st) three months, I worked with full energy and was actively engaged in my role. My efforts were noticed, and I felt a sense of purpose and accomplishment, and thought things were getting **settled** in my life. **However**, as time passed, I began to feel drained. My energy levels dropped, and my colleagues started pointing out that I looked exhausted and needed to take time off or take better care of myself.

In **November 2023,** and with me being drained, I was unexpectedly **told to temporarily transfer** to another department due to staff shortages. Although I felt the transfer was **unfair and beyond my capacity**, I couldn’t bring myself to object (say no) or discuss my concerns with my manager. The new role required me to work alone in a **highly stressful environment** with little support or training. The *sudden change* and *increased pressure* **triggered** a **panic attack**—though I didn’t recognize it as such at the time. I also began experiencing **severe anxiety** and for the first time in my life I had **wishes of death, imagining myself being dead** or even **choking myself for relief**.

Luckily for the first time, I sought help at the ***employee clinic*** around **December 2023**, I was asked so many questions and one of them was if my depression and stress were related to work. At that moment, I didn’t connect the two and said no, not realizing the link because I wanted fast help. This depressive episode lasted about **one month,** in which it prompted me to go to the clinic and start medication for the first time, leading to a series of medications.                              

**Fourth / Later Episode (Promotion Delay – November 2024, Age 26)**            

The fourth episode occurred **briefly** in **November 2024** when I was **promised** a promotion, only to have it delayed unexpectedly. Although it was a **shorter depressive episode**, lasting only about **one week**, I felt deeply **disappointed**, **frustrated**, and **hopeless**. I wanted to **express my dissatisfaction** to my manager but felt overwhelmed by the idea, which **stopped me from speaking up**. Being on medication at the time helped reduce the severity of the symptoms and accepting it as is, but it **led to losing purpose** in **career** and **life**! >>> I was able to speak to him in December 2024 about my disappointment of the delay, which relieved me a bit.

**Key Observations and Patterns**

**Age 27, Male**

**Family History:**

My **father** has **bipolar disorder (I have his report file with medications),** also one of my uncles has **psychosis.** I was told by my father that these conditions and mental conditions ranging from bipolar, psychosis, and adhd are **common** in **our family branch**. I was recently told that even my grandfather had bipolar, which explains a lot. Also, my father is pointing out that some of my brothers have symptoms.

1. **Mood Cycles:**
   * I alternate between:
      * **Depressive phases:** Sadness, social withdrawal, lack of motivation, and ~~suicidal ideation~~.
      * **Periods of energy (rare) & motivation:** Social confidence, high productivity (learning new things & starting new projects), and **impulsiveness** which is noticed after using Wellbutrin.
2. **Triggers:**
   * Stressful life events (e.g., toxic jobs, betrayals) often precede depressive episodes. (sometimes random)
   * All my major depressive episodes were caused by a reason, and all were in the year 2023, but before that, when I was 13-14, my depression came out of nowhere and I consider it a major one.
3. **Physical Symptoms:**
   * **Sleep issues** like oversleeping during depression / reduced sleep or staying up late during high-energy phases \[maybe personality trait or bad habit?\].
   * **Physical agitation:** (e.g., leg shaking, hand tremors and maybe Myoclonus?) It is linked to **Wellbutrin** because after reducing the dose it went away and then increasing the dose it came back.
   * **Forgetfulness:** It started after the new medications for mood stabilization.

**4.      Coping Mechanisms:**

o   *In the* ***past****, I* ***coped*** *with overwhelming emotions by* ***sleeping****,* ***playing video games****,* ***watching shows, and*** ***eating large meals (****led to overweight****)****. These provided temporary distraction but didn’t address the core of my struggles.*

o   *Since starting medications, my* ***coping*** ***has shifted****. Now, I find myself beside watching shows, I started* ***reading*** *about depression,* ***writing****, or sometimes unwillingly getting* ***low*** ***sad emotion****, which occasionally provides relief. However, these methods often feel like distractions rather than solutions, and the sadness or pressure in my chest tends to linger or return.*

***5.      Suicidal Phase:***

o   *I need to be honest, at one point when I was taking Prozac 40mg, my emotions were bland and at that time I secretly was suicidal, where I almost overdosed on my medications, I had them right in my hand and something is telling me DO IT! TAKE IT! I was so tempted to take it! Not only that, I was also searching for a peaceful way to die, but each time at the end I stop.*

o   *Currently I am not suicidal but looking back, I ask myself what made me be like that?*

**Medication Journey (Update as of March 2025)**

Diagnosed with Bipolar II by online psychiatrist, although I was told by the hospital it needs an assessment (currently on the waiting list).

·       **Prozac 20mg (Start: December 2023) – Employee Clinic / Resident/Consultation with** a psychiatrist I consulted

When I first started Prozac, it released my locked emotions, where my emotions were filed in a jar trying to escape, and the jar was pressurized from the locked emotions in it. Prozac came and opened the jar, releasing all my emotions, but in return, it didn’t leave any for me to live with, and it made my life bland and empty.

·        **Prozac 40 mg: (Around July 2024?)** Employee Clinic / a psychiatrist I consulted

It briefly relieved my emotions, but after two weeks, it triggered suicidal thoughts. I believe this was due to increased emotional numbness and lack of joy.

·        **Prozac 60 mg (October 2024):** Employee Clinic / Resident with consultation to a psychiatrist I consulted.

It was similar to the effect of 40mg and caused temporary sadness (only 1 week) and afterward emptiness. Currently I am at 20mg.

·       **Wellbutrin (Started Late October 2024) – Prescribed by a Psychiatry Consultant (A) –** 

Wellbutrin gave me the boost I wanted, similar to drinking an energy drink. It made me energized, but I was reckless when I was energized. I made big-time decisions fast. People like to call it a hypomania phase. Although Wellbutrin helped me with my low energy, but what is the point of energy if you have no desire in life? It caused severe side effects. I was told to lower the dose to taper off Wellbutrin, but doing so made my energy and motivation drop significantly. I thought I should at least take 75mg in the morning and 75mg at night, but I don’t think it did much in the long run. I was later unmotivated and had low energy, so I upped the dose based on the recommendation of a psychiatrist. I feel like I’m back to better now.

·       **Quetiapine (Started December 2024) – Prescribed by Psychiatry Consultant (B) –** 

Quetiapine helped me during sleep, but a higher dose was too much for me; it made my mornings sluggish. I started with 25mg before bedtime and increased till 100mg, but it made me extremely tired the next morning. I found that 25-50mg is the best dose for now, and I was told it’s okay to stay on it.

·       **Lamictal 25mg to 300mg (Started December 2024) – Prescribed by Psychiatry Consultant (B) –** 

It made me feel like my normal self again. I feel like Lamictal made my mood more stable but only stable, not higher or better. It was prescribed to stabilize my mood due to concerns about bipolar tendencies. a psychiatrist I consulted later told me to increase weekly by 50mg until I reached 300mg, which is considered the therapeutic dose. I currently take 300mg (2 pills in the morning and 1 at night). I feel like it made me feel back to myself, but gave me forgetfulness of short-term memory, I think.

·       **Aripiprazole (Started January 9, 2025) – Prescribed by a Consultant (C) -** 

Initially prescribed at 5mg after confirmation of Bipolar II tendencies, which overwhelmed me with sadness. I was later told to increase it to 7.5mg and then 10mg, but I stopped after experiencing severe restlessness where I needed to move a lot. It got to a point where I went to the clinic for help, but they didn’t do much. An online psychiatrist later told me to stop the medication. I am currently taking 2.5mg to taper off.

·       **Propranolol 40mg (PRN) – Prescribed to Manage Restlessness and Hand Jitter**

Propranolol helped with the jitteriness caused by Wellbutrin and with something I always used to have, which is a high heart rate. I was told to take it daily to help with the restlessness and hand jittering caused by Wellbutrin.

***Note*** *that I am currently feeling like each medication has helped in certain parts, but some parts aren’t fixed.*

***In short\* Prozac*** *only removed the pressure in my heart I used to have and released my emotions,* ***Wellbutrin*** *helped with energy,* **Quetiapine** helped with sleep, ***Lamictal*** *made my mood more stable,* ***propranolol*** *helped with side effects, for* ***Aripiprazole*** *I don’t know if it helped or not*

**Current Concerns**:

·        Severe restlessness when on Aripiprazole 7.5mg+, to the point it affected me at work since I work in an office. I was told to **stop the medication**, currently at 2.5mg, and **low restlessness.**

·        I **can’t** stay focused on boring tasks; I just stop and lose myself in thoughts. This has always been an issue, even before medications.

·        I lost my ability to pay attention to details

·        I **feel tired** each morning. I think it is because I sometimes stay late.

·        I **feel** like I am **stable**, but sometimes a **sudden mood shift** happens that lasts until the next day, and I can’t understand why. I am also trying to treat my lack of pleasure (**anhedonia**) and to treat severe sudden boredom.

·        I think I am having anxiety in terms of mental health and trying to treat myself out of anxiety.

I am currently also trying to treat other parts of my mental health, **see the following traits that have affected me all my life**, some are more of my personality:

·        In my childhood, I’ve always had trouble staying focused in class or on boring tasks, dealing with boredom, looking for more stimulants like playing, and following through on things. Although I sometimes have this thing where I might look like I am focused or distracted on something, I am actually listening to whatever people are talking about behind me and at the same time looking at the thing I am focused on.

·        I procrastinate a lot where I start things but never finish them. I recently started my second degree in CS, invested money in it, because it was my dream, but later I lost interest and motivation, I later postponed. I also sometimes start projects but lose interest later even though it was exciting at first.

·        I have future and past conversations in my head all the time, and sometimes it gives me a headache. I jump from one thought to another, or sometimes I have too many thoughts at once. This has always been an issue, and I feel like it affected my life, and I am not sure if it is normal or not.

·        I forget things a lot, I put something on a table, and moments later, I don’t remember where I placed it. I was told this isn’t related to Wellbutrin.

·        I have a spending problem, I tend to make fast decisions, sometimes regret them later, but I feel like that’s just my personality.

·        I struggle to stay engaged in anything that isn’t stimulating. Even when I start something important, I later stop because I lose motivation. Although when I have an incentive thing, I stay on it because in my mind it is either I finish whatever is in front of me or things will get worse for me and this how it got me through college, either get A’s or I’ll be a failure the rest of my life which gave anxiety back then.

·        I have this comprehension problem where I write words, my head fills the gap and I jump to the next word, forgetting that I didn’t write the word I was thinking about. Even when reading something I wrote, I see words that aren’t there or forgot to add them. It was much noticeable during my college years.

*My main struggles currently are the lack of joy,* ***motivation****,* ***commitments,*** *alongside unpredictable mood shifts,* ***mostly depressive episodes or severe boredom – (currently stable)***

*I am seeking a* ***treatment plan*** *that helps me stabilize and find balance in my life.*                          ",1.5317077052001298,0.036168569273612894,Negative,High-Risk
1j51i2n,depression,Life is actually unsustainable for me at this point,"I got laid off from my job last September. My car is totally broken down, and so old that even with basic repairs it becomes an impossible job for me and expensive because I can't afford to take it to the repair shop. 

I'm in a living situation where I'm about to be kicked out, living with my abusive ex. I'm living on unemployment that is about to run out in a month and a half.

Renting is unaffordable. The average studio is $1200 and they want a 600+ credit score and 3x the monthly rent. $3600????????? Not even my highest paying job could cover that. My credit score was destroyed by my mother a few years ago. She took out a credit card in my name, used it to buy who knows what, then stopped paying on it. Took me from a 4 bedroom house with a well paying job and 750+ credit score to this.

No home, no car, and the only thing keeping me alive is a cat. A cat I really can't care for once I'm homeless. I have NO friends and NO family. Not an exaggeration, not ""oh you must have one person"" no. I mean not a single living breathing soul outside of this cat. I talk to nobody on a daily basis.

My life is in shambles. I have no support, no transportation, no job. I'm trying to get a job but by then I'll be homeless and I can't use my vehicle to get to a job so I'm COMPLETELY fucked.

I don't have a will to go on. There are no services that can assist in time. I really think I just need to give my cat away and then end my suffering because I see absolutely NO light at the end of this long exhausting tunnel of hell.

I really have tried everything at this point. I've called hotlines and gotten referrals and I don't qualify for shit. I'm miserable and my life is about to get worse. It's either drugs and alcohol on the streets, begging for money and barely scraping by every day, or just ending it and being at eternal peace. There's really no other options. 

I don't know what to do, I'm tired and alone and afraid that my life will end exactly how I've anticipated it would since I was 9. With me dead by my own hand. I think the agony and suffering physically won't outweigh the suffering impending should I not kill myself. My soul is really exhausted. The economy going downhill now is making it worse and I really, really am ready to become a red splatter on the ground.",1,0,1741283675.0,"Life is actually unsustainable for me at this point I got laid off from my job last September.

1j4ueo3,depression,Falling back to suicidal tendencies in my 20s because of family,"Posting this because i feel like im old enough to have complete control over my mental state, but the truth is, i dont and i just wanna know if there is anybody out there whos going through this too. 

Ive been self harming since i was 15. I live with my parents since im still getting my degree and living outside is not an option.

I’ve been clean for 3 years and had started to self harm again after minor and insignificant arguments with my parents. Ive always had a rough time with my parents since adolescence and im considered to be the most “problematic” child because i call them out of their bullshit multiple times. Things on my childhood neglect, being mentally abusive etc. but damn bro, they can REALLY twist my words and make me seem like the villain. 

My mother even said once, along the lines that “i like to make up things in my head, and i like to think of things that dont exist” that was the tipping point of my clean streak. 

Then a few more disagreements like that would always make me fall back to self harm and i hate it. All my hard work, I shouldn’t fall back like this. 

I hate how they always have the way to make me look and feel like im SUCH a major disappointment in their lives and theyre SOOOO much better than me and i’ll never live up to them. I hate how small i feel regardless of my age because every time I call them out their bullshit, i just feel 15 again. 

More on my dad: I just thought he didn’t give me any respect because i was a teen/kid with my teen/kid interests and intellectualism but as i grow older now approaching my mid 20s, he doesnt change at all, in fact, he became worse. 

Im going to law school and because his circle involves the law and he knows a few a lawyers, he thinks hes the TOP DOG. He lectures me on concepts I’ve learned in pre-law and i didnt wanna look like a snob on my high horse (unlike somebody) so i just kept quiet. Or when he sees and irl crime he goes deep in law principles and doesn’t even let me talk. 

Ive tried talking to him multiple times, multiple conversations. If he doesn’t change then fuck it dont change 🤷‍♀️ (the funny thing is, he only does this with me, he doesn’t do this with my other siblings)

Ive always had a rough time with my parents since adolescence and im considered to be the most “problematic” child because i call them out of their bullshit multiple times. Things on my childhood neglect, being mentally abusive etc. but damn bro, they can REALLY twist my words and make me seem like the villain. 

My mother even said once, along the lines that “i like to make up things in my head, and i like to think of things that dont exist” that was the tipping point of my clean streak. 

Then a few more disagreements like that would always make me fall back to self harm and i hate it. All my hard work, I shouldn’t fall back like this. 

I hate how they always have the way to make me look and feel like im SUCH a major disappointment in their lives and theyre SOOOO much better than me and i’ll never live up to them. I hate how small i feel regardless of my age because every time I call them out their bullshit, i just feel 15 again. 

More on my dad: I just thought he didn’t give me any respect because i was a teen/kid with my teen/kid interests and intellectualism but as i grow older now approaching my mid 20s, he doesnt change at all, in fact, he became worse. 

Im going to law school and because his circle involves the law and he knows a few a lawyers, he thinks hes the TOP DOG. He lectures me on concepts I’ve learned in pre-law and i didnt wanna look like a snob on my high horse (unlike somebody) so i just kept quiet. Or when he sees and irl crime he goes deep in law principles and doesn’t even let me talk. 

Ive tried talking to him multiple times, multiple conversations. If he doesn’t change then fuck it dont change 🤷‍♀️ (the funny thing is, he only does this with me, he doesn’t do this with my other siblings)

1j4u5pn,depression,Is it just a thought,"Hi everyone, I've been wondering why we are here (what the point of it all is). I've had suicidal ideation on and off for years (at least age 12, I'm 40 now). I've been going through it a lot recently. I honestly wish I didn't exist and hope my life ends soon. However, I've also noticed it's just a thought and the thoughts that were causing the pain aren't an exact representation/match of my life or what's going on.

 I think the trick when going through it is to realise it's not true.(easier said than done). It's not true that I'll be homeless, that I'm useless, not good enough or attractive enough, will always be single etc. In fact, life is unfolding according to its will rather than my will. As the thoughts change so does the way I feel change. 

The thought that's happening at any point is what is causing the feeling. I can't know what the future holds yet I dream about it and if it's a negative dream I suffer. If it's a positive thought I feel good. 

I hope this helps someone who might also be struggling and hasn't had this realization. Plan activities if you can. Even cleaning your room, car or house can help stop the train of thoughts that are causing suffering. You're probably a lot more attractive than you currently think you are. You probably have a lot moren going for you than your mind wants you to know about. 

Struggling with relationships? How do you feel in yourself with yourself, by yourself? Do you believe in yourself? If not, may I encourage  to do some inner child work (IFS is a fantastic modality). Basically, you want to start to give to yourself all the love, validation, acceptance and encouragement that you never received. Develop an internal voice that loves and supports you no matter what!!! Through thick and thin. A voice in you that just supports you all the way. 

If you're really going through it, I'm deeply sorry and would love to be able to help (suffering sucks). However,  sometimes we need to be with our suffering in order  to process it and move onwards. I learned how to give  myself a hug and massage myself with love...
 Imagine your signaling to the universe what you need and it may send a real person. My relationships have improved dramatically in the last 2 weeks since realizing it's not outside that's the problem but inisde (the way I feel and think about me). Sending you love, positivity, self kindnes, acceptance and encouragement. You can do this! You can have an awesome, wonderful life doing amazing fun things with beautiful, loving people 😁😘🤗

I often catch myself when I get upset over petty things, and I feel so entitled to be upset over them. And then I get even angrier at myself and the cycle continues.

I found out my boyfriend has been cheating on me, probably for the entirety of our relationship. Or that’s what i’m telling myself in my head.

Well. This past week. Since I found out about everything last friday. I’ve felt myself return back to this life sucking depressed feeling that I struggled with for years. I’ve called out of work everyday since, and i’ve quickly fallen behind in school. Since I’m trying my best to not relapse Ive been drinking, which I don’t normally do, and smoking again.

I have no energy whatsoever. I just want to lie in bed all day or sleep. Everything feels exhausting and any step to change my life seems extremely painful or tiring. I'm passively suicidal in that at least once a day I will wish either I or the world didn't exist and that I wouldn't have to go through this slow process of mental and physical deterioration.

Growing up, I was never allowed to go out by myself. It had to be with a parent, even when I was in my late teens. So I just stayed inside and played games. I never went out apart from for school or when I was taken out once a week at the weekend. Because of this, it always felt like it was wrong to go out by myself for something that wasn't school or work. 

My dad would want to know where I was going, with who, if they were a boy or a girl, and if they were a boy if they were gay. It seemed more trouble than it was worth.

When I was 19, I got a job and worked for 4 years. Because my dad had always bought our food, I had always been fed oven box meals or takeaways for dinner. For the rest of the day I would subsist only on the yoghurts and chocolate he bought. Even in times when I had given him a list of healthier foods to buy, he never did.

Finally with my own income, I had groceries delivered (the cupboards and fridge were full for the first time!) which meant I had 'real' food to eat at last.

He didn't like that at all. You could see it in his face. 

""What are you wasting money on that for?"" 

""You better eat all of that!""

There was a tension when the food was delivered and when tension builds up like that he would explode. 

Growing up it would always be like this, every week or so another explosion where he either broke stuff or took his anger out physically (although never hard enough to leave bruises). So after three attempts at buying my own food I gave up. I'm pretty skinny because his food is all I have to survive on.

I worked another 4 years after a one year break from work but I have never earned enough to rent a place to myself despite my qualifications and experience. I think I could have afforded to rent a single room in a house share but my dad never allowed that. He said renting is a waste of money so I never spent much and saved up the equivalent of $65k for a house so I could be free. I stayed  inside and took no holidays, but on a low single income it is impossible to buy by myself.

Because I always felt like I was going against my dad if I went out, I never met anyone or dated or made friends. I'm scared he will follow me or try to find out what I'm doing. I've never even had my own bedroom even though I'm 28. I share with a sibling.

As a result of this, my mind and physical health has slowly disintegrated over the past 8-9 years. I had to quit my job from exhaustion - I wasn't and never have got anything from working because any attempt to spend my money was seen as a waste to be avoided. It all seemed pointless. I would never be free anyway.

I've been unemployed for a year now.

My mind is clouded mush. I breath slow, tired breaths. I sleep until the afternoon, eat the chocolate and cookies he buys even though I know it's killing me. I don't go out. 

And yet, I have no energy to change my life, as it will always be as it always was. My futile efforts have proven this.

I have been subject to Dys disorders since childhood, and am subject to major procrastination problems that have totally ruined my life. Sure, I got my degrees, but I never revised or worked. I regret it enormously today. I was also neglected about my appearance, even if I recently made an effort. But I don't find myself particularly beautiful. My voice is ridiculous, too.
I think I suffer from variable social anxiety. And severe depression since the death of my grandmother eight years ago now. I have had a generalized anxiety disorder for three years and no experience on my CV. As a result, I have little or no general knowledge.

And then, I have other problems...
My father is toxic. To the point where he disgusts me. Even if I have too much empathy, I don't want to see him anymore, or to suffer his threats. He's not really the father I would have wanted to have.
But above all...

I hate myself. I'm bland, weird, with a changeable personality. I don't know what I want. I manage my frustrations badly and I'm a toxic partner.
I've hurt a lot of people since I was thirteen, but I've never managed to change any of my flaws. I've even thought about committing suicide but I'm a believer and too cowardly.

When I was young, I always got back together with someone. I really liked to please too much, and I was emotionally manipulative. Of course, it stopped since then, but even though I really liked my current boyfriend at first, although toxic at first, my anxiety disorder and my change in feelings towards him changed my attraction to him. I still like him a lot, and I want to love him, I want to love him because he loves me with a pure and sincere love, has been irreproachable with me where I have been unfair with him, especially for gifts. I feel so monstrous. After all, I am very far from being special. And I cried at our first breakup, but I feel like I am afraid of being alone. Ironic then that now I isolate myself more and more. I have loved other people madly, been cheated on, but I can't do it anymore. Something it’s stuck, and i hate being harsh or abusive...but i can't stand his fetishes anymore,  while mine frustrate me a lot, I don't want to sleep at his place anymore... and so, now when he gets angry, he forces me to compensate with rp and I do it, even if it's not healthy, it's his way of forgiving me for being this way..
I don't have any high standards, and I think I love him in a way, but I'm so lost, I want to kill myself, everything is confused in my head, I don't want to be like my father and I'm far from deserving another partner or to be loved..

I hate myself. I'm bland, weird, with a changeable personality. I don't know what I want. I manage my frustrations badly and I'm a toxic partner.
I've hurt a lot of people since I was thirteen, but I've never managed to change any of my flaws. I've even thought about committing suicide but I'm a believer and too cowardly.

When I was young, I always got back together with someone. I really liked to please too much, and I was emotionally manipulative. Of course, it stopped since then, but even though I really liked my current boyfriend at first, although toxic at first, my anxiety disorder and my change in feelings towards him changed my attraction to him. I still like him a lot, and I want to love him, I want to love him because he loves me with a pure and sincere love, has been irreproachable with me where I have been unfair with him, especially for gifts. I feel so monstrous. After all, I am very far from being special. And I cried at our first breakup, but I feel like I am afraid of being alone. Ironic then that now I isolate myself more and more. I have loved other people madly, been cheated on, but I can't do it anymore. Something it’s stuck, and i hate being harsh or abusive...but i can't stand his fetishes anymore,  while mine frustrate me a lot, I don't want to sleep at his place anymore... and so, now when he gets angry, he forces me to compensate with rp and I do it, even if it's not healthy, it's his way of forgiving me for being this way..
I don't have any high standards, and I think I love him in a way, but I'm so lost, I want to kill myself, everything is confused in my head, I don't want to be like my father and I'm far from deserving another partner or to be loved..

Every plan or new hobby gets dropped quickly. I lack discipline and I’m unable to do anything long term. All I do is nothing.

I get so anxious about remembering it all and then failing a quiz/test. It makes me quit and go play games instead to avoid my problems.

After I came off of Effexor, I have taken the biggest nosedive in my life and was admitted to an inpatient stay. 
I was prescribe Cymbalta, Strattera and Buspar. 
The Buspar wasn’t working, so I was prescribed propranolol PRN and Xanax PRN. 
After 5 weeks of taking Cymbalta 60mg, it isn’t working and I’ve had to now find another psychiatrist to help me manage my problems as I am now recommended to be on stimulants for my adhd and they couldn’t prescribe them.

I wake up anxious, racing thoughts, and just plain tired of life. Then there is the adhd symptoms of lack of focus, forgetfulness, overwhelming executive dysfunction and task paralysis. 

I’m also working a new job at a hospital and it’s very involved for 17.50/HR, but the benefits are amazing and after a year they will train me for medical assisting and pay for my certification test. 

The anxiety follows me all day and all I can think about is I never finished school and I owe $12k in student loans from 2 semesters at a community college and esthetician school that I have no idea how to pay back, I have some medical bills from my inpatient stay and that I feel like I’m stuck with trying to figure out how to do what I need to get into a better paying career that I actually like because I had to leave esthetics due to the economy, social media killing my mental health and no benefits. 

Right now Xanax is the only thing that is keeping me calm and I’m so scared of being dependent on them.

1j5ff1k,Anxiety,Anxiety and depression after partner broke trust.,"Hey reddit peeps. 
I am medically diagnosed with GAD. 
Long story short, I have been in a relationship for the past 16 months. Things were going good. 
A week ago I caught my partner lying to me about where they were (Share my location on iphone and finding out they were at a hotel), I confronted them and they ended up admitting that they may have caught feelings for someone else, which included just a kiss at party event during a drug fueled state 2-3 weeks prior. This person was with them at the hotel at the time, which they confirmed was just to set boundaries due to what happened at the party. 

At first we broke it off, then I said I wanted to work on the relationship. 
Since then my anxiety and depression has come back tri fold. I have no appetite, I’m not going to work and taking a Valium almost daily. Suicidal thoughts at times etc. 
I have started to meditate, go for daily walks and try to preoccupy my mind, but it seems to not be working. 
I am also back to seeing my psych. 

Today I decided to bite the bullet and discuss what had happened and if he has any idea what led to this. He called this a drug fueled pash which confused him for feelings and that he booked a hotel to get away from his parents as this whole situation has been making him stress a whole month since the party and him not telling me to begin with. 
I ended up putting things on a break, no contact, no social media etc. (we tried this last week, but they wouldn’t respect my boundaries and apologised for this later on). 
They have also been stressed and worried as they know what this has done to me mentally. They have apologised for what this has done to me and that they have no feelings towards this person at all.
Now I am worried that I have done the wrong thing and instead of working through it, I have put a pause and it’s going to make everything worse. 
I am not sure how I feel towards them and it was one mistake that they did. We have never had a disagreement prior to this. 

Did I make a mistake at stopping contact? 
Should I work through our issues to bring the anxiety and depression down?
Or should I focus on my own mental health and then see if we can work on the relationship/friendship if it comes to that. 

I still care for him, but I’m just not sure if I could trust them again or if I am in any headspace to make these decisions. 

Any help with the depression and anxiety would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks

1j5b4zo,Anxiety,Unsure how to live mentally,"Just a heads up, I have this listed as NSFW because I’ll be mentioning suicide & self harm.

I (M18) have been through a lot in what little time I’ve lived. I’m not gonna say I’ve had the worst of situations, because I definitely haven’t. But I haven’t had the best either. I started abusing weed heavily around 15 and only stopped a few weeks ago. My friends joke with me and say they never expected it or I’ve “fallen from my prime” but the truth is it has caused so much anxiety and even (what I think was) a very very long psychotic episode. 

When I was mid-16, I started buying weed from a friend of mine as it just smelled really good and was good when I first began smoking it. However once I began smoking more of it, I found myself dissociating and questioning life for the first time ever. I began having horrible thoughts and anxiety about death and my existence. Often followed by me breaking down and the only time I wasn’t crying, was when I was sleeping. This went on for almost an entire summer. I believe this sparked a spiral of panic, anxiety and depression for me that I’m still in today. I regret smoking like I did, not only bc of what it caused mentally, but because of what it may cause physically. 

I’ve always thought of suicide and went through my stages of self harm. But I always had this thought of “things will get better with time”, that’s why I never really took things too far. And I wouldn’t say I believed it, but it was kinda the only thing I could look forward too. 

I lost a very very close friend in December to suicide, his birthday was on Christmas but he died on the 7th. We had stopped talking as much a year before, but he was my best friend and I believe we were still close. Just living our own paths for a little. He had also went through very suicidal times, even when we were friends. My mind still can’t comprehend that he’s gone but it’s been 3, going on 4 months.

Everyday I think about him. I have so much regret and hatred at myself for not talking to him more. I even asked him to hangout a day prior, and was waiting on his response. I didn’t know he didn’t answer because of that. I’ve been struggling with my anxiety, depression and physical health way more since this all happened. And I hate to say it, but I’m feeling like going down a similar path. Life feels impossible right now, im constantly disassociating and hating myself for everything. I have thoughts of achieving everything I want to in life, but I believe that even if I get to that position, that I’ll want to still do it. I miss him, I miss my family who’s passed too but the difference is that you kinda expect your grandparents to pass, even if you don’t think about it. But you never expect a friend to die so early. And it kills me to imagine what I could’ve done differently.

I think about my girlfriend, her family, my family and my mutual friends with my friend who passed. I think about how they would all react and I just hope they wouldn’t hate me for it. I think about trying to be a shitty person, just so it hurts them less. I keep questioning myself if the only point of my life is to continue to spread a message of men’s mental health by doing the same thing. Or am I supposed to do it while alive? But the only issue with that is, you can’t really do much while you’re alive. People don’t really care about ANYONE, let alone a man until they commit suicide. I don’t know how to fix my emotional state.

I’m scared of the future, especially the possibility of a world war, and this has taken away all my motivation to build something for the long term. I’m studying medicine, which is my dream, but I wonder if it makes sense to continue if everything could collapse in a few years.

Because of this, I’m starting to question whether it makes sense to invest years of my life in something so demanding or if I should instead focus on more immediate goals. I feel like giving up everything and dedicating myself to “easier” and more attainable things, like getting a Mazda MX-5, going out, having fun, and living in the present without worrying too much about the future. Basically, I don’t know whether to keep pursuing long-term dreams or enjoy life while I can.

This dilemma is wearing me down every. single. day.
This confusion prevents me from making decisions and I feel predominantly sad and stuck. I can’t enjoy any moment, whether good or bad.

On a personal level, I’ve never had a girlfriend. I don’t consider myself ugly. However, I lack self-esteem, both physically and socially. I feel insecure and don’t know how to behave romantically with girls, which makes me feel somewhat inferior to others.

1j4t2ff,Anxiety,Is what I'm experiencing an anxiety induced panic attack?,"Trigger warning for suicide.

For context, for the past about 6 months I have had an overdue honurs thesis with a ""fuzzy"" due date which is the cause of my anxiety. I have recently gotten a job under the assumption it would be complete in a competitive field where reputation is important, so I feel as though my life depends on this. I have moments where I suddenly feel terrified, my heart rate rises, i suddenly feel hot, and I can't think. My breathing becomes shaky, i sometimes get the urge to flex my muscles, as in tightening my grip on a desk or forming a fist, and I sometimes start shaking. I'm not sure how to describe the worst sensation, but it feels as though my brain has frozen, beginning from the back of my head. In that state my thoughts slow down, and I find it difficult to do things that are ""normal"", everything feels forced or weird. That last part all occurs when I feel that brain freezing effect. 

This happens to me a few times a day. While sitting, working, relaxing, and pretty much always when in the shower and have time to think. I sometimes find myself laughing quietly because I feel like my life is so fucked. I frequently end these periods by telling myself it doesn't really matter because I'll just kill myself if it doesn't work. I've dealt with severe depression before and have come close to suicide, but I got better, and in my mind I don't recognise this as something I am going to do in this instance. The severity and number of symptoms varies a fair bit. I know the cause of my anxiety is this thesis, but I hadn't really considered it was a panic attack until recently. Is it one?

From here on this is further explanation of the situation/venting. They've been far more common recently because I have dealt with things pretty badly. My supervisor and I agreed a due date, and then I asked him a week before it if I could extend my thesis to the next semester, because I couldn't do it in time. He said that was impossible and that I could take some extra days to do it beyond the due date. Two weeks after the that due date, I accidentally saw that I had 3 unread emails in my uni portal and i couldn't think straight for hours. I became so anxious about it that I decided to stop checking my email until it was finished and I could just email it to him.  I managed to take time off from work from then and started going to my 24/7 uni library to work. I would stay there for about 24 hours each session, then go home and sleep for 10-14 hours, making about 30 hour periods of being awake. This was hell while I didn't check my email and I've done it for about 3 weeks now. I've lost any sense of time and am afraid to check any communication. Whenever I speak my voice is raspy because I haven't spoken more than a few courtesy words to anyone for the whole time i haven't been working. Isolating myself was probably a bad idea like always, but its too late for that now. As in it's too late to change that choice, I am not currently suicidal.

I'm not sure how to describe the worst sensation, but it feels as though my brain has frozen, beginning from the back of my head. In that state my thoughts slow down, and I find it difficult to do things that are ""normal"", everything feels forced or weird. That last part all occurs when I feel that brain freezing effect. 

This happens to me a few times a day. While sitting, working, relaxing, and pretty much always when in the shower and have time to think. I sometimes find myself laughing quietly because I feel like my life is so fucked. I frequently end these periods by telling myself it doesn't really matter because I'll just kill myself if it doesn't work. I've dealt with severe depression before and have come close to suicide, but I got better, and in my mind I don't recognise this as something I am going to do in this instance. The severity and number of symptoms varies a fair bit. I know the cause of my anxiety is this thesis, but I hadn't really considered it was a panic attack until recently. Is it one?

From here on this is further explanation of the situation/venting. They've been far more common recently because I have dealt with things pretty badly. My supervisor and I agreed a due date, and then I asked him a week before it if I could extend my thesis to the next semester, because I couldn't do it in time. He said that was impossible and that I could take some extra days to do it beyond the due date. Two weeks after the that due date, I accidentally saw that I had 3 unread emails in my uni portal and i couldn't think straight for hours. I became so anxious about it that I decided to stop checking my email until it was finished and I could just email it to him.  I managed to take time off from work from then and started going to my 24/7 uni library to work. I would stay there for about 24 hours each session, then go home and sleep for 10-14 hours, making about 30 hour periods of being awake. This was hell while I didn't check my email and I've done it for about 3 weeks now. I've lost any sense of time and am afraid to check any communication. Whenever I speak my voice is raspy because I haven't spoken more than a few courtesy words to anyone for the whole time i haven't been working. Isolating myself was probably a bad idea like always, but its too late for that now. As in it's too late to change that choice, I am not currently suicidal. Venting over I guess.",2.0170781342277473,0.5377999437010792,Negative,High-Risk
1j4krn7,Anxiety,please Help!!!,"So some background to my question above.
I have pretty bad OCD, depression and anxiety. My OCD is very focused on my health with revolving illnesses and diseases being my obsessions. 

Last July, I had a pretty bad episode and was hospitalized because I thought I had rabies for no apparent reason. Since then I have had periods where I was ok and periods where I was very depressed, anxious and pretty much housebound. Since then the diseases have cycled from rabies to ALS to stomach cancer to chronic fatigue syndrome. Those have been the main 4 with others sprinkled in. Every time I have one of these obsessions they normally last anywhere from 2 weeks to 1.5 months and then my brain gets “bored” of the old illness and obsesses over a new one. I’ve convinced myself that I had all of these symptoms whether I actually did or they were imagined. I’ve been suicidal through these last 8 months on and off. Most recently I was obsessed with stomach cancer so I went thru multiple tests and an endoscopy to get cleared. Right after this, after my mind was at ease, I went right back to the ALS. I have been convinced the last 4 weeks that my hands and neck were weaker and shaking. I have had had multiple blood tests multiple times, X-rays, EKGs etc. I have spoken with multiple oncologists, neurologists, GI doctors, my GP and it’s the same result everytime. Nothing is wrong with you. 

So this past Wednesday (1 week ago) I returned from a vacation of 10 days and had an early flight and was traveling from 6 am until 7 pm and then had to go right to a dinner. When I got home from that I crashed and woke up feeling fatigued and just not rested. 

I should also mention that 4 weeks ago I started an increased dose from 200 to 250 MG of Zoloft and am on 150 MG of Wellbutrin. I take the Wellbutrin in the morning and take the Zoloft at dinner time (was just moved up to dinner time 3 days ago due to the fatigue) About 2 weeks after starting the increase while I was on my trip I was having horrible nightmares, sweating while sleeping and just bad sleep. My sleep habits are just pretty bad in general as I stay up late and tend to wake up late. 

I am currently not working due to these issues because my situation is so debilitating. I was really great and happy on my trip and when I got home the fatigue started.

I am now convinced that the fatigue is most definitely related to the ALS and that I’m doomed. I just feel really tired, worn out and exhausted. Just no motivation or desire to do anything. 

I’m here just looking to see if anyone ever experiences these physical issues and then relates them to an illness. I’m at my wits end and I start an intensive program on Monday. 

Just not sure if I have really anything wrong with me and should go to doctor or not.

Sorry for the long post but this is my first time on here and really struggling. 

Thanks in advance for any help, advice and guidance. 

Feel free to DM if you have any suggestions or questions. 

EDIT: I also quit drinking 6 months ago but I do vape and this past Saturday I drank for the first time and got very drunk (not on purpose) I think due to the meds.",1,0,1741227050.0,"please Help!!! So some background to my question above.

1j4aygv,Anxiety,How bad is this level of anxiety?,"I sometimes feel like I exaggerate, so I want to ask if this is an average, low or high level of anxiety…

I started having anxiety that impacted my everyday life about three years ago now. I got medication and felt better for a while. Now I’m off medication (I had some side effects issues) and though it took a while, the anxiety is back. 

I have an almost constant pressure across the chest all day. Sometimes it’s a little better, but often it feels like a heavy bar or a burning. I have a constant lump in my throat. My stomach has butterflies all days, but no pain there. My heart raises sometimes, but not that often. I have trouble focusing, which is interfering with my work. I sometimes cry when alone. Not depressed, it just feels like doom is approaching, often without me knowing how or what. When I get deep into work for a couple of moments, I can sometimes forget the anxiety, but it always returns shortly. I have real trouble getting out of bed in the morning, it’s a sheer force of will. If I could, I would just lie in bed for eternity. I just can’t work out (lift weights) anymore, stopped last week due to feeling so damn afraid all the time. I haven’t told my closest family, as am worried I’ll make them worried. I have some suicidal thoughts, because it feels like the painful feelings are a bit too much. But I won’t do it at the current level, I thinks it’s manageable still. But I’m also afraid it won’t always be.

1j3y7jo,Anxiety,I typically have 5-10 anxiety attacks per day and I feel so alone,"TW: suicidal thoughts, s*xual assault

I’m about to type a lot, if anyone reads the whole thing it would seriously mean the entire world. I’ve had anxiety for probably my whole life, but within the last 11 years it has skyrocketed to a whole different level. I also have a number of other mental health problems, such as depression, PTSD, bulimia, and BPD, and every day feels like a constant battle between myself and my anxiety and my surroundings. It never ends. When I’m out and about I get overwhelmed because there’s so many things going on, but when I’m in a quiet safe zone my mind thinks it has permission to go insane since I’m finally relaxed. I don’t get a break unless I’m sleeping, except WOW now I’m getting anxiety attacks in my sleep. I get them from really really tiny things, such as my water being too cold, an apple being too mushy, wearing a necklace too close to my neck, eating eggs, my back hurting, wearing a backpack and the strap being on my neck, spiders, being around a lot of men at once, and so much more. But I also get them from more “severe” things, and those ones are so deadly. I like to think of my anxiety attacks like a really steep mountain, where the bottom of it has thoughts like “I don’t know how to get out of bed without freaking out”, then the middle of it is stuff like “I need something sharp”, and the top of it is where it becomes almost irreversible and I have no choice but to jump off of the mountain and succumb to the thoughts and urges. I could go down the mountain from there, but it’s so steep that I can barely walk and I most likely will trip and fall anyways. Yes I am in therapy, I’m in the process of switching medication to get one that works better for me, I have a pretty good support system, but I still feel so fucking alone. My anxiety attacks have led me to suicidal ideation, I’ve had multiple attempts throughout the last few years, some of them were so close that I had to go to the hospital. It just feels like the end of the world and I can’t live like this. I can’t even enjoy good things in my life, for example my friendship with my best friend of 3 1/2 years. She is my rock and has gotten me through hundreds of anxiety attacks, she knows me better than I know myself, I love her more than I can explain, but I feel like I’m holding her down in this friendship because of my anxiety. In a weird way, having her as my friend makes me want to k*** myself more, because if I’m gone then she won’t ever have to worry about me ever again. I can’t ever tell her that though because I don’t want her to interpret that like we shouldn’t be friends anymore, that’s not what I want at all and I definitely think that would make me even more suicidal. But it’s like..I can’t even enjoy a beautiful friendship without these thoughts lingering. It fucking sucks. For context, I was sxually abused for 4 years between ages 10-14, and that caused irreversible damage for me. Now any time I am in a situation involving something he used to use on me, or if someone touches my back/waist, or someone says his name referring to someone else with the same name, I freak out like crazy. People think I’m weird and skittish for it, I just tell them I get scared easily, but it goes a lot deeper than that and I wish more than anything that I could just stop. It’s preventing me from living my life normally, I can’t even go outside most days because I’m scared I’m going to get hurt, but at the same time the only thing that’s actually out to hurt me right now is myself. I’ve done more damage to my body and my mental health than anyone has, and that’s after I was r***d hundreds of times. I can’t run from myself, I can’t take a break from being in my body, I can’t just become someone else for a few minutes to decompress. I’m stuck. I just want it to stop. It’s insane how mental stress can impact someone’s life so much. I wish more than anything that I could live normally and not be affected by everything. My best friend fully believes I’m going to get better, and I don’t know how to tell her that I’m more on the edge than I ever have been. I don’t know how to tell anyone that to be honest. So that’s why I’m here. I’m not looking for a diagnosis, I don’t need empathy, I just want to know that someone hears me and understands.

Bear with me my first language isn’t English… not my second either 

I’ve been doing horrible recently, one of my other 
 friends lost everything while gambling, he’s been sleeping on my couch for almost a week. I don’t have the money to support the both but I also don’t have the confidence to tell him to leave because he doesn’t have the money to live on his own.  

I’ve also been dealing with a lot of stress from work, as well as gender dysphoria from little things like being called the wrong pronouns and worse always having to choose between the male and female bathrooms because there isn’t a non binary one.

Not to dump too much but i didn’t have a good home life growing up, after I came out my parents were abusive too me because they didn’t really believe in those things. Also there was needles just lying around the house because of drug use. Used to purposely and unintentionally prick myself with them all the time. Once CPS took me away life didn’t get much better because being a fostered teen, I wasn’t really the priority, the smaller kids were. I didn’t really get the help I needed, I got addicted to multiple different things while still in care, I did some pretty risky things physically, sexual, etc

Because of this I’ve started cutting myself again, and have been doing a lot more risky and dangerous things in general, including stuff based on sexual activity. I attempted yesterday and I couldn’t be less excited to be alive. I think I might try again tonight, maybe third time is the charm? 

Please just someone talk to me…?

Sometimes I get into fights with my mom and then really wish I was dead. 

Today we went out and my mum and I got into a fight over something stupid and now I wish I was dead and really do. She bought me a record I wasn't exactly keen on. And then told me I have to clean my room, which is mostly clean. Theyres just boxes from when we moved. And she's mad about it. I'm really upset and overstimulated because of other stuff I've mentioned on my page and she simply doesn't care about my friends and how much I'm affected by them. 

And with my great-grandad slowly yet steadily dying right now, there might be someone sleeping in my room with me while they're in town for his funeral. I get my room is big, but my room is a very sacred place for me and my room is important because it's where I go to just cry and feel stuff that I need to feel with my mental health. Having a cousin in there would just really overwhelmed me and I hate it. We only have 1 spare room which will be used for my aunty and uncle when they come too

Schol is really stressful right now and everything at home is just tying into it and I just really wish it would get better. But it's not getting better. So I want to kill myself to get away from it. 

The fight I had with my mom kinda made me feel like my mom wouldn't care if I killed myself just like how my friends wouldn't either. I got told off by my stepdad for the first time earlier today and I just want to kill myself to make everyone else's life easier and happier.

I wanna hang myself. But it wouldn't kill me fast enough and I can't cut my wrists because it's too hard to hide. And I'm 571 days clean. I really what to know what would kill me fast.

We’ve been hunting down answers and keep coming up empty handed. And because there’s no answers, there’s no help or relief either. To make things worse, I also have chronic stomach problems + severe emetophobia. AND on top of all *THAT*, I’m autistic. My body is constantly in a state of fight or flight, despite being way too exhausted to feel that way. I have panic attacks every night because I’m a supervisor where I work and I’m constantly afraid that I’ll be ill and unable to make it in and lose my job. 

My partner has been my one true peace for years now, and we haven’t felt connected for quite a bit now. I often feel like I can’t work on healing myself with another person present, so I ask to be alone often. I don’t like being touched anymore. I actually dread the idea of any sort of physical intimacy. We can’t go on dates, I can’t handle eating out or being far from home anymore.

I love him more than life itself, I wish he got to know me when I was younger and could almost pretend life was okay. 

I’m getting to the point where I can’t get out of bed anymore. I can’t clean, I can’t go to the grocery store. I’m in a constant state of panic.

I’ve been turned down by other telehealth services before for suicidal ideation, because it would be “too dangerous” and I should “seek in person care” instead for my safety. 

The real kicker is that I don’t feel that I’m cynical. I love my life. I love the people in it. I love every little bit and piece of it. I see myself as having a rather happy & positive disposition.

I am very very lonely. I have nobody near me that I can talk too about anything, and any people that I care about are so far away and too busy for me. I have been struggling to make friends since I moved but I've recently met some people I'm quite fond of, but they all have their own lives and I honestly don't. I was meant to meet up with a few people today and literally everyone cancelled on me. This led to a full-blown breakdown, nobody has time for me anymore. I cant tell if I keep giving people reasons to disregard me or if people keep giving me reasons to hate myself. I spent most of the day on the phone with 111 option 2 (mental health crisis line for those not in the UK). I've spent the rest of the day wondering how long it would take anyone to notice if I take myself out to the woods and hang myself. I just hacked up my shoulder pretty bad for the first time since I was about 15 and I don't know what to do. I want to be a person like everyone else but I feel like I lack something fundamentally that makes you human. I want to be loved, I want to love myself, I want to laugh and cry with people but I feel as though I'm just existing in this state of mediocrity and misery and I cant see a way out. I don't know what I want to accomplish by posting here, I think I just want to feel seen.

1j6urx8,SuicideWatch,I think I'm all done here.,"At 40 years old I fucked up my entire life. I had everything, a beautiful wife, 2 amazing kids and a great life.

I've been a great dad and made sure my kids knew they were loved and how proud I am of them. I've always had such high morals and prided myself on being a good husband and always being there for my wife through thick and thin. 

 I was selfish and made a horrible decision and cheated, I cannot forgive myself, Im not even sure why I did it. My councillor thinks it was because of all the loss I've faced over this last couple of years but that just seems like a cop out to me, I know we had gone through a couple of hard months before this happened and I think I was just needing some kind of love or appreciation and I sought it out like a fucking idiot instead of talking it out with the most amazing person I've ever known. I hate myself for what I did.  

We've been separated since late november and i've done everything I can to try and fix things but it's over, I can't even believe it, I feel like this is all a nightmare. I can't even understand what was going through my head, that wasn't me, I have no fuckin idea.  

I've written my suicide letter and want to put some things in place for my 1 and 4 year old, any recommendations on what I should make sure is in place? I want to make sure I'm covering everything. 

I feel so bad that I did this to them but I think it's best if I leave now before they have the capacity to remember me. 

I'm considered getting a tank of nitrogen and a scuba mask and go out that way but then I almost feel like I should go out more painfully, I don't deserve a painless death, I deserve to go out suffering badly. 

I don't really know why I'm writing this I guess I just needed to get it out there, I can't keep going like this for much longer, I'm hanging on by a thread.

It all started in my early teens and this is another porn addiction story , I’m not saying this is the only reason I’m just saying it’s the biggest one . I got a really bad porn addiction to a specific kink or fetish which is absolutely disgusting and I prefer not to name , I was watching it and masturbating to it multiple times a day every day for years and I’ve only learnt how bad it was in the last 8 months . I’ve never told anyone about this fetish and I’ve self harmed multiple times because of it and how many times I keep relapsing to it .

1j6rpla,SuicideWatch,"We need to either follow through, or find a reason to keep going. Forever fence sitting is pathetic.","I’ve come to a realization. Being chronically suicidal is stupid. You need to either do it, or move on and find a reason to live. Staying in the “I might do it, I want to do it.” Frame of mind is worse than actually killing yourself. You’re snuffing out any potential you have left by wasting it wishing for death. Once you get to the point where you snap, you’ll decide whether you want to actually die, or push forward. I have chronic pain. I can barely stand or walk. I’ve had to stop doing all the things I love. I wake up in pain, go to work in pain, come home and go to sleep in pain. The other night I reached my breaking point. It was either *actually do it* or find a reason to wake up tomorrow. I decided that living in pain is marginally less shitty than dying in it. Life is pain. It’s made me harder, colder, in ways I don’t like. But I’m still here, because I reached the point where I had to choose death or life. I chose a life of pain, because that’s just part of what life is. You don’t always get what you want. I’m ugly, short, introverted, crippled, and depressed. And I’m always in pain. Sometimes I curl up into a ball in my bed and scream into my pillow because of how bad my legs hurt. But I’m still here, and my pushing through the pain has given me something to be proud of. I know for a fact this sort of pain would make a regular person fold like a lawn chair and give up. I decided not to, and *just that* has given me a reason to keep going. 

If you want to put this behind you, if you ever want a semi normal life, you need to reach rock bottom and choose between life and death. You either find a reason to keep going, or you don’t. But if you don’t, follow through. Because the “life” you’ll lead while wishing you were dead is no life at all. Make your choice and live or die with it. Any other choice is meaningless.

she screamed about divorce, leaving, splitting the family money, living alone, going back to her home country because i was such a vile repulsive disgusting waste of life that she was ashamed to have created all because i didnt speak to her or respond to her for a week. she said i deserve to hate myself and that i dont deserve life at all. my dad tried to comfort her while he shifted the blame on me

she said that she put so much effort and money into me and lowered her expectations for me to succeed so far only for me to become the biggest mistake shes ever created in her entire life and that im her biggest burden and cause for suffering. she called me a monster and an evil demon sent from hell to make her suffer. my dad defended her and said she is only worried about me and wants me to live a good life and said i was spoiled, stubborn and narrow-minded.

i had to apologise and say that i would never disrespect her ever again and she still got mad because 'the time period for forgiveness was over.' i had to promise that i would never misbehave or make her mad again under any circumstances. as usual all the blame fell onto me and im the loser failure waste of space of a human while shes the good mother whos only worried and was pushed too far

I have been crying for hours now, and I don’t know how much longer I can take this. Talking to people who aren’t suicidal feels like talking to a wall. Not only do they not understand, but they also can’t seem to articulate anything beyond generic phrases like, “Things will get better,” or “I’m here for you.” That’s why I decided to make a post here, since we’re all here for the same reasons.

I was born and raised in a country where child abuse is heavily encouraged and normalized. Both of my parents come from very dysfunctional families, and they’ve normalized abuse as well. From my childhood until I was about 15, my mother physically and psychologically abused me. At 15, she stopped the physical abuse, possibly because it started reminding her of the times her own parents hit her. However, the psychological abuse has continued. My father only hit me a few times in my life, but he was the main instigator. He would poison my mother’s mind, telling her that if she didn’t beat me, she wasn’t a good mother. I hate him for that, and I hate her too because she’s always biased—it’s always my fault, and I’ve brought everything upon myself.

Things started going downhill when I failed four units of my A-levels back in May 2024. I had already been depressed for a while, and this only made it worse. My mother had to forge my results to show my father, or else he would have halted my studies. In my country, if you’re not an exceptional student, girls are generally married off, and boys are encouraged to take up manual labor or jobs that require little to no educational qualifications. Because I was so depressed when I took two more units this January, I failed again. I decided to switch to a foundation course instead of continuing with A-levels because I find them too difficult. When I tried to explain this to my father, we got into an argument. He’s incredibly ignorant, and my attempts to reason with him were futile.

We went back and forth, and at one point, he told me he would start preparing for my marriage. I locked myself in my room after that. Apparently, I’ve ruined his prestige because now, when people ask what his daughter is studying, he’ll have to say that I’m a coward who got scared. Those are his words, not mine. I don’t think I did anything wrong. I’ve always dreamed of a life where I’ve left this country, living alone with a pet cat. I dream of peace and freedom. But I’m 18, and I can’t even move out because it’s not socially acceptable here. If you live alone, you’re slut-shamed and accused of wanting multiple sexual partners—that’s the only reason people can fathom for wanting independence.

I really don’t know what to do anymore. If I was meant to live, my life wouldn’t be this difficult and painful. I’m so tired.

Coincidentally my parents had a bad fight recently too and my siblings and I are seriously wondering if he's finally going to divorce her. He's having us meet up this weekend without my mom to talk about everything that's going on. 

During the most recent fight my mom said some things that strongly suggested suicidal ideation. She doesn't have a job and would have a very hard time supporting herself if they split up. My dad has multiple unlocked firearms in the house and during each ""attempt"" she's grabbed my dad's guns and thought of doing it with them. 

I dont know if it's preemptive to call emergency services, nothing has happened yet and she seems okay. However if they do end up splitting up I'm very very concerned it will happen.

1j64qap,SuicideWatch,I genuinely think that I am not cut out for life,"
I don't think I'm cut out for life. I don't feel like I'm fit in or in place. I am emotionally sensitive and empathetic. I don't feel like I belong. I can't find a job that pays a liveable wage. I have had a good amount of jobs for my age.  Don't have a driver license yet and I can't afford lessons right now but whats the point if I can't afford a car. Even if I work full time and make 600 a week I still wouldn't be able to afford one.

 I am in community college for accounting. I worked 30 hours a week at a pharmacy and made 400 a week still not enough. I can't afford anything and it sucks to know that this is how life is and I would have to work 3 jobs. I reduced my hours to focus on studying but now I can't afford hobbies or all of my needs and definitely not any wants. 

Right now I'm still studying but don't know how I will keep paying for college since my father is a tax evader for fafsa. I could do a payment plan but It will be all of my money. I binge eat. I don't have anyone to talk to. I have mental illnesses including depression and when I was on antidepressants I gained lots of weight and binge eating got worse so I stopped. I see a therapist and it doesn't help all they do is just suggest meds. 

My dad is dying and I never grieved my brother committing suicide. I'm lonely but a man could quickly make my life worse and more complicated. All the jobs I've been applying to virtually pay the same $12-18. I'm back to self harming. I feel like a failure and feel guilty for being alive. My parents are abusive but I don't want to have a victim complex. I still live with them and I am not able to afford to move out even with roommates. Maybe my expectations for earning is too high and my standards for life as well.

I went to beauty school to become a certified nail technician just to find that there's virtually no job openings out there for that near me at the moment. Or they are part time working 1-2 days a week. I'm considering selling press ons though but its a saturated market and I don't know who would buy from me. I have had 2 businesses ages 16-20 that flopped. Multiple hobbies that flopped and there is absolutely nothing that I am passionate about or enjoy. I don't enjoy entertainment either.

I'm not sure what to do with my life and how to feel better and I have been forcing myself for the past few weeks to forget every single thing and move forward but I genuinely do not see much to be happy about.

When I confided in my friend she said I'm privileged and my life is not that bad and they have it worse. I'm not doubting others have it worse at all. What prompted me to write this post is while searching for a new job because my current one I am very underpaid and staff is toxic and I am sick of abuse from the customers, I realized I still can barely find anything that would allow me to live that I got overwhelmed and cried and my mother said that I need to grow up and asked me how am I going to manage to survive which is true, and I don't think I will to be honest. She also said that me crying causes her stress and said that the stress I cause her and my dad is what turns them to drink. She says I make excuses which I think is true in some cases. I have been dissocoating for the past 6 years and every second every minute every week every month and every year passes by me in seconds. I will wake up one day and be 50 if i make it to then wondering where all the time has gone. 

I think the people in my life think I am weak which is true. I'm not even trying to seek pity or be self pity or a victim but I just don't see the point. I am not a victim it is all my fault and I believe any abuse that I have endured I must of have deserved it. I just get easily overwhelmed and I don't know why and I am immature.

Nothing succeeded after i went to university, i had no goals i couldnt function or have normals interests.

I was admitted to the psyh ward by my dad in 2024 april and stayed for about 21 days i beleive. After that i was addicted to benzos but my substance use started to decline to to having no job and couldnt find one. I had a strong try with kratom to get a job and have a daily routine but my dad saw that i became very addicted to kratom so i had to stop it.

I got offered an own rented house by my day who always supported me and when i moved in i just felt an intense responsibility which quickly killed my alcohol habit in october and i went to several job interviews and kept changing medications because something weird started happening it started with depersonalisation and derealisation but it turned into 0-24 dissociation. I spent all my day playing on xbox or cleaning the house but and i also became paranoid of everything and everyone.

My social life vanished basically, i developed total apathy and couldnt move out of the house. I had a suicide attempt with a knife but in reality i just poked my hand so see if i feel pain at all and my pulse went up to 160-180 so i stopped.

Few days later my dad visited me to go shopping together and told him that i cant take this anymore and even the hospital wont help.

My dad thinks i over dosed my medications but i really didnt. Now im one month in with “OCD” clompipramine 150mg and 6mg of clonazepam daily. I cant talk to people properly due to 0-24 dissociation, the therapies there doesnt work and i cant express myself properly.

So all in all:
My doctor sees improvements
My dad thinks iam improving and what iam saying is all OCD.
My brain overloaded and started accepting there is no way out but iam just passively existing.

In reality: i do not contact with anyone im paralysed in fear and cant function in society and have no thoughts or goals.

Only to get to another hospital for ect or any other things to try thats my only last hope. Only electroshock honestly or any type of biological outer help because therapy does not work.

I will have a talk with my doc to tell him about my suicidal thoughts and that i cant function outside and if i can get an ER or anything but its all hopeless.

I want to be magicaly reset and get me thoughts and feeling back but i lost my identity basically and i dont even ask for help, because its so hopeless that i just let everything fall as slowly as possibly thats the most i can do.

My parents feel confident that everything is okay. In reality i try to be calm around them and tell them that i need er and please do something. But they dont want to process or hear about my view. Everyone around me is in complete denial that i only have 0-24 suicial thoughts cause my brain is not working.

Tomorrow i have to talk with my doctor about my situation and i will tell him that the suicial thoughts are in my head and iam in extreme fear.

Any inputs are appreciated, i cannot function in live and have no motivation for anything, i cant tell everyone how i feel becase all i can tell is that i feel disconnected from everything.

Please help.

1j5y61c,SuicideWatch,My birthday is 2 days away,"my name Tena (my surname) and I’m from the philippines, I just had a sudden burst of emotion for the past week and I can’t control it. Hiding behind a smile isn’t working for me anymore. Back then, I used to look at suicidal people like they are on some crazy shit, but right now I totally get them. I just finished preparing the medicine that I am going to use to commit od. I know that there is more to life, but I just can’t stand it. od is a slow and painful but I really don’t have the balls to use a knife and cut myself or jump off a building.

for the people who knows me, I just want to say that I love you all and I’m very sorry. To my mother, ma, I’m truly sorry for leaving way too early, thank you for believing in me, in my eyes you were the only one who supported me in this family through out my life, I love you sm. To my siblings, I love you both, even if both of you have shortcomings I still love both of you. To my father, you weren’t the greatest or the best, but you’re the only father I have. You encaged me so much that it’s so hard to breathe that I have no freedom anymore. just so you know, I forgive you, for everything that you have done, especially to my mother and my sister. I can see that you are changing for the better, keep it up, pa. I love you

And for my friends, I’m truly sorry that I never spoke about my problem. I want to be remembered as being the open, oversharing and cheerful guy around. It’s unfair that I am not going to witness all of you succeed in life. but if ever heaven or hell truly exist, I hope that, be it evil or good spirit, I am able to guide and watch all of you.

If ever my message reached to one of my friends and family, I hope you that you share my message since I really don’t want to leave behind without saying anything to all of you.

what I’m doing is very selfish but I think I needed this. it’s the only solution I can think of. 

i’m happy to think that my birthday is 2 days away from now, I hope that people I love will celebrate it with a smile.

for the last time, I am very sorry.

1j5litv,SuicideWatch,feel as if my world is caving in,"im sorry if this is all over the place. my brain is just about the same, and my insurance got stopped suddenly, so no therapist to hear me out anymore.

my 22nd birthday is coming up. the last two years have been a blur. my parents went from forgetting i existed on my 20th birthday to hating me last year, and it looks like this year theyre both in my life again.

i failed two attempts when i was 19. both on sleeping pills, one i went to the psych ward for, and one which i didnt and still has my brain messed up.

i live in an acceptable apartment. it isnt the best, but definitely not the worst. i have a fiance who loves me, and they do so much more than show it. im fed, i have water. im grateful for what i do have, dont get me wrong. but im a loser. not much of a social life. im fat, and way too self conscious about it. im a drop out with no job. i cant seem to get better. i feel stagnant, and i keep losing people. all i do is sleep, eat, drink, game, and repeat. sometimes i spice it up by getting ice for my water. how brave.

my fiance brought a gun home last week. its registered to them. no ammo, and its on safety just for that extra protection. but that fucking thing keeps screaming my name. (not literally, i promise i am not hallucinating a screaming or talking gun.) i keep imagining the sweet release. even when my partner was here, id be playing happy, cooking and holding their hand. and the only thing in my head would be imagining how amazing that metal would feel against my skull.

am i a lost cause? what the hell am i supposed to do? ive thrown myself at Jesus, begged for help. i spoke to family, and nothing. its all the same bullshit. ""it will get better"" or ""itll get easier"". how am i supposed to believe that when ive wanted death for so long now? ive been suicidal since i was 12, and those last two attempts just made me want it more.

1j5fm4s,SuicideWatch,"Close minded, open book","I like myself, and I don't feel I'm your everyday definition of what people view as what someone would expect to see as suicidal, however having some attempts over the recent years that narcan thwarted, I'm pretty confident that the end is near. And I'm OK with it, I'm not exactly sad over the fact, moreso over the decisions that I've made in my life that have led to the decision.
I've messed up pretty bad.
Life has been a roller coaster of success stories, and long hard falls.
I'm an intelligent, well educated guy. High school, graduated college with a 4.0. Humility aside I'm one of those people that short interactions with me lead people to say I'm one of the smartest people they have ever met. And I'm not stuck up about it, I'm only describing myself accurately for means of this post.
Nevertheless I'm not only human, but I'm one of the dumbest smart guys I've ever met.
When I got out of juvenile detention (2 years) at 18, I discovered synthetic Marijuana. It became illegal a short time afterwards, and I was the local guy who figured out how to make it. First just for me, then a couple ounces here and there sold to maintain my supply for free, and within 6 months I was importing a kilo of the synthetic cannabinoids and cannabimemics every month, and UPS would drop off a 100lb box of marshmallow leaf at my garage door every 3 months. I supplied the surrounding counties and large portions of the state for the next few years. I don't want to make this the main part of my story, so I'll cut details short here and say the end result of that was a couple year prison sentence that lasted to my mid twenties.

Following that, within 6 months of my release I had new felony cases for the same crime, and they sent me back for double the original time. I was released from prison at 28 years old.
While incarcerated I got my CDL, I got the treatment I needed, and when I hit the streets I hit the ground running. Sober and driving a semi for a company that gave me a shot 18 days out of the fence. I excelled to the point that in just under a year, I started a trucking company with a guy who had a similar story and got his CDL inside with me. We purchased a truck and trailer, and we made so much money that 4 months later we bought another of each. Put two guys behind the wheel of that one who were locked up with us, made them partners, and our best week their trucks $14,100 profit was only bested by our own $14,900. $29,000 in a week, legally made and accounted for, by 4 convicts out of prison under 2 years, it was incredible.
I got engaged. Shit went south. Kid got cancer. I don't expect them to ever come across this post but on the off chance they ever do, I'll leave out the details because I don't want them associated with this. I loved those kids, and when their mother who got pregnant with my own first child ran off right before giving birth, it destroyed me. Partially my fault, there was mutual abuse. Shit got unhealthy. It is what it is.

I got into meth. Anyone who has gotten into meth from what I can tell seems to be able to function for a while. Normally about 2 years in my experience, at least when trying and having a life to give a fuck about and all. I hid it well, until my partners quit the company (drug problems of their own) and trying to keep it afloat, I wrecked half a million in equipment falling asleep at the wheel. Totaled both trucks 60 days apart. Praise God nobody else was involved.

That ended my trucking career. I managed with other jobs, always reminiscing on what I once was and how far I had fallen. Eventually I got too into meth to maintain responsible living, and although I learned my lesson about selling drugs (I refused to learn to make meth or sell it much, simply because how personal synthetic use turned to importing bricks and a drug empire that led to losing my 20s to incarceration), but eventually I considered myself a professional booster.
A booster is a thief. I never stole from people, and from the first time I began profiting selling drugs in my teens I didn't steal a thing from anyone or anything for 10+ years. I was that guy that when loading $300+ worth of groceries at Walmart noticed a toothbrush at the bottom of my cart I accidentally didn't pay for, I walked that toothbrush back inside to scan it and pay before I left the parking lot (true story).
Years after that story, I was the guy taking orders from anyone who would pay cash or drugs to go get their shopping list for them by walking right out the door with it and charging half price. Electric scooters? Done. Your water heater went out? I can get you a new one cheap. Need a washer/dryer? Lowes has a set on display between their inside and outside doors, and nobody will suspect a thing if I put them on a dolly and load them into my truck. Shit, an employee may give me a hand when they see me loading it. Doing a kitchen remodel? Let me grab my high vis vest real quick and I'll walk right past the pro desk checkout with all the cabinets you need. Better yet, spend the half price of the cabinets with me, and I'll even throw in whatever paint and brushes you need for free. May as well, they fit on the same cart. Blizzard conditions? Snowblowers are on sale, in box on the shelf, and who in their right mind would be walking out with a huge Snowblower in their cart unless they paid for it?
Your kids, wife, family, etc need new clothes? Nike, Adidas, Under Armour, send me the sizes and what you're trying to spend. Give me a grand and I'll give you a discount, say $4000 tag price? Run it.
That section got too long, apologies if any reader is still with me. Point was it was disgusting, and it got so easy for me I stopped even worrying the times I did get questioned. Leave the cart at the door, I'll be back next shift to try again, or I'll go to the next store and try. I made schedules of which stores on which days didn't have someone at the door. Planned their break times hours in advance and would circle the state, surrounding states even, just to fill orders and feed that particular addiction (stealing becomes addictive). Even today, when I no longer steal, going through a checkout is it's own type of high. Doing the right thing feels good. And I'm in no way trying to glorify the negative things I've done, I'm just trying to describe them accurately. 
Now it's years later, and shit is catching up to me, as God says it would. You reap what you sow, God is not mocked.

On a few separate occasions, I got busted with meth. Small quantities, what I consider personal use. 14g one time (I had just got it, hadn't even touched it, 2-3 week personal supply between self and girlfriend). 1g another time. 5g another time.
Where I'm from they take it and indict you later. In my case two years later.
I finally sobered up. I quit stealing. My license had been suspended and I got it back. Working 2 full time jobs and a part time, hoping to get back into driving truck with half a decade between me and my wrecks. 
Then the indictments came. 3 months in a row. 2 years after getting caught.
Now I've done 6 years in prison for the synthetics. Manufacturing drugs. Large quanity possession. Trafficking. Big boy stuff.
I watch many people around me dealing with similar charges, with histories worse even than mine, and they all get rehab, maybe a year. Someone got 2 years on the high end. So I expected something similar.
I talk to my attorney and learn they want me to do 4 and a half years. It blew my mind. Worse so because it had been so long, and I had turned my life around.
This is getting pretty long. My bad guys, I try to write well enough that the read isn't difficult while including enough details to keep interest, but I've always been told I write books. 
Long story short, I just don't want to deal with the reset again of prison. I did this 10 years ago, and more recently with high success 5 years ago (rounded) when I got out and started my company (3 actually, I also owned a detailing company and a roadside assistance/auto repair business).
Now because of my poor choices years ago, they want me to go back behind the fences for half a decade and start over fresh, with nothing, at nearly 40.
The shitty thing is, I could do it. I've been there and done that, and I could do it again. By 45-50 with hard work and my skill sets, I could be right back on top. And I just don't want to do it again.
I'm tired. I made the choices I made, and it sucks but I can't unmake them. Life has no reset button, but if we are keeping score, I'd be in the bottom of the bracket. I had so much potential, and I threw it away. I still could rank with the great ones if I kept playing long enough, but I just don't want to do it.
I'm saved, Christian, positive what happens after I die. And when God asks why he should let me into heaven, a suicide with the history I've got in this world, I won't tell him how hard I tried, nor of all the good I've done to outweigh my bad. I won't plead for mercy or beg forgiveness. I'll tell him His Son paid for my ticket when He took my place, and I believe that wholeheartedly. It's the only answer I have, and I know it well enough to risk damnation on it being the right answer.

So I've got a couple months left. I'm getting myself right out here. I'd like to put up enough cash to cover funeral expenses. Maybe repay some of the debts I have to family for helping me bond out of jail before these pending cases end. Spend my last bit of time leaving the best impression on those that love me so after the fact they can have more to say about me than the negativity that led to this choice. But come the right time, I intend to take the other option besides the reset of prison and starting over, and instead just press the power button on this life. There's plenty of eternity left, this time here being just a drop in an endless ocean ahead. And it's shitty, I don't necessarily wish it didn't have to be this way because I understand it doesn't have to, but it is the choice I've made and find solace in, knowing that at least the control over my life won't be placed back into the hands of a system of people that know nothing about me beyond what a cop wrote down a few years ago.
I sincerely apologize for how long this was, dear readers. I've crept around reddit for a bit and never even really in this sub much, mostly doordash and random stuff (thanks for the laughs, the entertainment, and feeling like I'm in the company of people that use their brains sometimes) but this is my first actual, like, post. 
Typical of me it would be longer than every post ever posted on reddit, combined, haha.
Not sure what people will respond, if anyone does, but thank you for your time. Not seeking sympathy, or pleas not to do it. Respect to those who choose other than my choices, respect to those who have gone through similar and came out on top, or are in the process of it and getting there. Not encouraging anyone to follow my paths, but maybe someone will get insight into their own journey, or the head of someone they knew going through some shit.

1j5bo25,SuicideWatch,One final post before ending it all.,"Hi reddit, tbh idk where to begin or why am i even typing this. Im just tired guys, im typing this and thinking in my head ""how am I gonna describe my state and how much pain I'm actually in, I don't think I can do this with words"" but here goes.

Im a 27 year old dude and in the worst state I have ever been. It's mainly because of an ungrateful girl that I spent more than a year with and thought she was the one Im gonna spend my life with and that's what she used to tell me anyway. 

About me, Im a very gentle, super kind hearted, honest, loyal and emotional person and I take feelings very, VERY seriously. I treat my partner the way I wanna be treated. Never cheated, never will, never broke someone's heart and probably never will. 

It all happened so fast, I was in shock and I almost had a stroke. What I felt that night, in both soul and especially body, I'll never forget. She broke up with me and over a text. There was no changing her mind, there wasn't even a valid reason for the break up, and I didn't even get closure. 

Im not going to go into details so I don't make this longer than it already is, but the amount of good I did for her and the way I looked after her, not even her fucking dad did it better than me. And I would do it again, because to me, that's what loving someone is. Just genuine, unconditional love, care and devotion, in the purest of forms. 

Her problems became my problems and I didn't mind, I wouldn't mind in a thousand years. Otherwise what's the point of loving someone if you don't help them as much as you can and support each other and have each other to face anything life throws at you? 

It was a VERY intense relationship... It was like a dream more than reality, the amount of comptability we had, in everything, the communication, the sex life, the little details, the emotional maturity, the things in common, man... 

Like why would you throw all of this a way and destroy a guy that loved you was obsessed with you and loved you in every way despite all of your flaws? 

There are A LOOOOT of things I wanna say in this post, but It's just too much to type and it would make this very, very much longer.

Bottom line is, It's been 3 months now. Im broken, shattered, devastated, fucking OBLITERATED.

The amount of pain I carry and feel is just beyond words. A sense of doom, a sense of dread, IMMEASURABLE sadness, despair anger and void. 

It's just excruciating guys, I can't tolerate it anymore. I fought, tried to focus on myself, tried to work harder in my shitty job, tried to focus on music (im a musician), tried to play more on my PC (Im a PC gamer and especially Wow player). 

Nothing makes me feel better. I don't enjoy anything. I literally almost haven't laughed in 3 months.

And my emotional and mental state, manifested itself into physical symptoms: always throwing up for no reason, as if all the stress goes to my stomach, heart problems that started since the break up happened, its that feeling you get after a jump scare, you feel like your heart skipped a beat and almost jumped out of your chest, it happens randomly and then I get a tunnel vision effect for a few minutes, non-stop nightmares and overwhelming, uncontrollable crying due to the sensation of void and immense sadness that I feel. 

Infinite suicidal thoughts that I feel like seriously acting on them. Im just a broken shell of a human being, suffering from something I didn't deserve. 

And to put salt to the wound, 1 month after the break up, I heard she spent 3 days somewhere with some dude from the place where I used to study (she studies there after I suggested the place to her, it's an academy for arts etc..). She told people she's done with relationships. And here I am 3 months and still DEAD, I heard she got engaged recently.

It fucking destroyed me. I felt like a worthless piece of garbage. Words cannot describe how I felt and how I still feel. 

Another detail I forgot to mention, when I met her, she was depressed, lost and broken. I stuck with her, supported her every I can, I stayed and I fought and suceedee, I made her love life again when I, myself was broken, she always thanked me for that. She was just flabbergasted of how much of a good heart I have. 

Now, not only she got engaged, to a dude she barely know, (idk I heard he had money, I don't know tho, but she was never the type that cared about that, at least that's the image she showed me) and to put EVEN more salt to my wound, she went to people and told them bad things and lies about me. 

I already have very low self esteem and I suffer from anxiety and depression... Like that's just straight fucked up.

When I heard I was in shock again, I could do nothing but cry and cry and I was hitting myself. I went into a frenzy and I almost killed myself. I never did anything from the things she said I did. 

I could do many, MANY things to hurt her after she done that, but I didn't. And even if she hurt me even more, I still wouldn't, because Im bigger than that and Im a good person. 

Is this how you repay someone that was more than good to you? Isn't it enough that you killed me on the inside? That you stomped me when I just got back on my feet in life? (That's another story, I have other problems, finances, family etc but that's another story)... Why would you do this? It's beyond cruel, it's BEYOND brutal.

First thing I thought about when I got a job was spoiling her and taking her on a date she'd never forget. 

The amount of courage and effort it took me to get this job is just mind blowing. It's a job in a call center, ""it's a shitty a job"" most of you will think, I know, but fuck the job, Im talking about the fact that someone who stuttered, all his life, overcame his fear and doubts and worked in a call center and DID A GOOD JOB AT IT. 

The way I used to see, it's like ""an amputee that wants to play football on a professional team"", it doesn't make sense, he has no legs, he can't. But I did it, I overcame something that was always a barrier in life for me. 

But it doesn't matter, now, Im just an empty shell, suffering and feeling excruciating pain, sadness and grief. I feel alone when Im surrounded by people and I am TERRIFIED, of everything, but especially of the idea that Im alone and that I'll never have what I had again. 

The second Im on my own, walking, in bed, eating, showering, dread overcomes me and excruciating feelings of despair, sadness and anger overwhelm me to the point where I can't hold back my tears.
I can't tolerate it anymore. I just learned how people and how cruel people can be, and I don't think I can live in a world like this any longer.

I didn't even fathom that a human being can feel this much pain, it's ridiculous. The feelings of hurt, betrayal, sadness, the weight I felt and I still feel to this day... Like, wow. 

Anyway, I said it and I'll say it again. I couldn't tell my story the way I wanted, Im overwhelmed with the things I wanna say and I probably forgot important things to mention but I think that's it for me guys, I was always kind to the world and to life but it just didn't care about me. I know, some people have it worse, with wars and sickness and diseases... But I just can't deal with it anymore, it's too much hurt and pain for me to bear, I tried tho.

This will probably be my last post, maybe some of you will support me, maybe some of you will troll, but it doesn't matter, Imma probably be dead very soon I won't even see it. Im scared, though. 

My advice? Stay kind if you are, the world needs more genuine kind hearted souls. 

This is probably goodbye guys, bless you all! ",1,0,1741310215.0,"One final post before ending it all. Hi reddit, tbh idk where to begin or why am i even typing this.

It made me a weird kid. I was silent for a long time. I was obsessed with sex and pregnancy. I was super anxious about my cleanliness. I didn't wear short sleeves or shorts, and never took my clothes off in the dressing room. Not even my socks. I couldn't brush my teeth without gagging and to this day I still can't stop spitting water out of my mouth when I'm in the shower.

One night when I was 17 years old, I locked the door of my childhood bedroom and put a 9mm carbine in my mouth. I was crying and shaking with fear, trying to work up the courage to push the trigger, and after about an hour of sticking the barrel in my mouth again and again, I wussed out. Looking back, the fear that kept me from going through with it was just a materialization of my hope. I had hope that life would get better, that I would be leaving something amazing behind, that I would be able to move past the shame and disgust and hatred left over from my assaults and just be normal.

A lot of things happened after that. I became an alcoholic and a drug addict. I met the love of my life, the most beautiful, loving, sexy, affectionate woman in the world. I completed college, albeit with a massive amount of struggling. I got sober. I had two beautiful boys who I'm so, so proud of. I got an amazing job. But even in sobriety, even after receiving so many beautiful gifts I never deserved, the depression got worse, the anxiety, the shame, the disgust in myself. It grew like black mold in a moist basement. Slowly and inevitably.

Fast forward thirteen years later, and on new Year's Eve for 2025, I was pacing back and forth in the bedroom of the house I own with a Sig 9mm at my temple. The only difference was that I wasn't crying anymore.

As the breadwinner for my wife and children, the only thing that stopped me the second time was the fear of what would happen if I financially abandoned my family. I couldn't stop seeing them selling the house, moving in with Grandma and Grampa, and starting from square one. I love them more then I hate myself, and I just couldn't do it. Especially to my wife. I'm her caretaker and her protector. I'm her leader, her keeper, and she's my perfect baby girl. She doesn't deserve the pain I've put her through over the years.

But the hope is gone. The shame and the humiliation and the hate have turned me into a monster. This is the only way I can keep them safe. I don't want to hurt them anymore. I don't want to feel it anymore. The plan is in motion, and I have to wait just over 700 days for some things to fall into place so they will be financially covered after my death. I've fought as hard as I can, I've done therapy, counselling, AA, I've been sober 7 years. But I'm hurting them. I'm not emotionally available anymore, I'm depressed, I'm irritable, and I get way too mad over the smallest things. I'm neglectdul, selfish, distracted, and worst of all, the horrible, violent fantasies are coming back. I'm turning into the man who raped me. And so this is the end.

My only hope is some kind of breakthrough. A miracle. But after all these years, hope feels like a foolish notion. They say suicidal people don't want to die, they just want the pain to stop. But I really, truly want to die. I want nothing more than to save the people around me from the sickening blight that is my presence in their lives. But I have to keep going for more than 700 days. Over two fucking years.

I don't wanna drink anymore, I don't wanna do coke, I don't wanna pop a bean or a xan, all I want is to just fly away into a khole and say bye. Maybe I've dissociated so far that I don't want to come back. Being in reality is so unbearable tbh. As much as I'm running away from reality I'm also just trying to touch that rush again. Idk. 
I've been Cali sober for a few weeks now. 
I had a beer actually, but I didn't even want to drink enough to get drunk. It hurt my body to drink 2 beers more than a huge ket binge.

I currently run my own business, solopreneur. It's a very successful business, and I'm thankful for that. Problem is, I get addicted to things VERY easily. I hate finding new people to sell to, but since I'm always figuring out smarter ways to do the other things in the business (read: LOTS of automation), I'm really good at freeing up my time during the day. Then when all that's left to do is to prospect, I fall into the traps of addiction. 

At first I thought all I'll need to do is just give myself more things to do during the day and then I won't feel the urge to be engaged in my addictions, and that worked...while it lasted. Once I didn't have as many things to do I just kinda relapsed. 

I also 100% use these addictions as an escape. Like when a customer sends me an angry email or when I get a large refund or when I'm having relationship issues (which I think I've since solved), I think ""omg, this is so dumb"", and then get a HUGE urge to escape.

I've been addicted to porn, YouTube, gaming, and producing music (yeah, that's a thing: when I start producing a song I get so caught up in it that I can't take my mind off of it, and even after shutting the program down I get the urge to ""just finish up that ONE part"" as soon as there's a break in the action at work or if I experience a trigger). I don't get addicted to anything in particular at any point in time, it's more just like me trying to fill up my time and escape doing the annoying stuff, so it's whatever I feel like doing.

I'm currently listening to ""The Easy Peasy Method to Quit Porn"" on YouTube and that's been great; I'm trying to listen through once with a focus on escaping porn for good, and then I plan on going through it again with a focus on escaping gaming for good as well.

I was suffering from anxiety and depression when I was sober, but obviously failed out after drinking 24/7. I was having panic attacks, couldn’t tell what dreams were real or not, etc.

1j6az9x,addiction,"Today I accepted the fact that I am addicted to cocaine, and I fucking hate myself.","This is gonna be a long post. I have literally nowhere else to put my words though, none of my family or friends (besides the 1 friend who has occasionally done it with me, but to their knowledge does not know that I do it on my own constantly) know that I do cocaine almost daily and it is eating me alive.

It started out how it ‘usually does’ - few bumps maybe every couple of months or longer during special occasions, then a couple of months turned into every other weekend, especially when drinks were involved, to every other day after I got robbed in a city I’ve never been in before that set me off into the worst bipolar depressive episode I have ever had. 

I was doing SO fucking good before too. I had all of my bipolar meds that kept me steady, I became addicted to the gym and working out daily for hours straight, rarely drank alcohol - I looked fucking great too (because I was healthy lol) Then I decided to go to a music festival in a city 8 hours away that I have never been to before; my first solo trip… and then I got fucking robbed. All of my ID’s stolen (which sucked immensely because I drove there so the drive home was risky) and my credit card as well. I slept in a Denny’s parking lot for 3 hours to sober up off the few drinks I had in the festival and then drove home sobbing and feeling like a complete idiot. 

I don’t even really think it was the whole robbed thing that set off this horrid episode because when you have Bipolar, you know that what goes up absolutely comes crashing fucking down. I knew I was gonna crash, this robbing situation just accelerated it. 

I got super fucking depressed and suicidal, had an attempt on my own goddamn Bipolar medications - which led the hospital to completely cold turkey me off of every single one without the help of a psychiatrist (as he was on vacation during the time lol). To COLD TURKEY off of fucking anything that changes your brain’s chemicals is absolutely ass, I have absolutely never felt this way in my entire life. I literally feel like my soul left that day but my body is still here. Time doesn’t feel real - it’s Monday and then I lay in bed all day and suddenly it’s 3 fucking Mondays later. Literally everything is out of wack in my system, STILL. This robbing incident took place in July, it’s 8 months later and i’m still in this fucking depressive episode and on top of it, I forced my own self to confess that I have a pathetic issue with cocaine. 

I had enrolled in college and started in the end of September, but by this point I was so fucked up from the cold turkey meds situation that sleep was nonexistent to the point I was seeing shit and became super paranoid. I could barely wake up everyday for my 9 AM classes and even when I did, I would fall asleep during the entire class (can sleep anywhere else but in my own bed when I’m supposed to, I guess?) So I bought a bag of cocaine.

At first it was GREAT, I was able to go to class alert and actually participate in my course discussions, I didn’t feel so much anxiety while socializing in my class, and it didn’t matter if I was running on no sleep - I was awake. ‘I’ was in control of myself for the first time in months - no longer wasting the day in bed not knowing what time or actual day it was being a complete hermit. I was actually able to function. But then of course, it started to suck. Obviously coke fucks with your sleep and I already wasn’t sleeping, so I found myself bumping lines at 7 AM daily (even if there wasn’t class, just so I could get that alert, non-depressive fatigue feeling and clean my house fully, go to the grocery store, etc) all the way until 7 AM the next day. 

*It has been 6 months of this and I completely fucking hate myself.*

I don’t do it every single day, sometimes 2 days in a row, pause for 1 and then back again or 3 days without any and then the rest of the week I am a coked out loser. 

I am a VERY functional addict but obviously everyone could see a change in me, essentially rapid cycling through different emotions every single day (really depressed and quiet to happy and outgoing) but for the last few months, I haven’t been able to get that outgoing happy feeling from it, I just feel sad and anxious and I keep thinking of how fucking stupid I am. And how gross coke is. And how I am a ‘coke head’. 

I’m hermit-ting again and everyone notices but they just assume it is my Bipolar. I just don’t feel like myself enough to be around everyone else. I haven’t felt like myself in 8 months. It has actually been really interesting because throughout the period of doing coke constantly, I have noticed changes in myself behaviour and appearance wise and have thought of myself as some sort of fucked up science experiment. I have actually really fucked up my health too, which continuously weighs on me because there is nothing and nobody else to blame it on but me, because I do a very gross and depressing habit. I hate myself. I hate myself so fucking much. I hate that i’m too ashamed of myself to be around anyone because of my actions yet *why haven’t I stopped then?* because you are a fucking addict. I hate that I’ve been missing appointments and repeatedly having to do apology tours and lie about being really sick as the reason for missing them, when really I missed those appointments because I stayed up for 13 hours straight with my nose in a bag and then needed to sleep, thus missing the appointment. I hate how I fucking look, my hair is thin and sad looking and my skin that was once a beautiful deep tan olive tone has turned grey and dry - *dead looking*. I hate how I feel every time I wake up the next day with a stuffed up nose. I hate thinking about how much of a fucking pathetic loser I was the night before when looking for cocaine remnants in my carpet - like holy fuck, what is wrong with you???

It sucks because I am SO hyper aware of what I am doing to myself and I just sit there and crush myself over and over again, only to do the same thing the next day and then mentally berate myself for being an absolute moron. The concept of it is so simple, just stop doing cocaine - yet it is so confusing because I actually don’t even know why I keep doing it.

I do not get withdrawal symptoms, granted I only give myself a week of a break off of the drug, but I do not have any *physical* addiction symptoms, just mental. If that even makes sense. I can go days without it, but the moment I see it in a TV show, or see a meme about drugs, then I want to do it and I do it. Maybe that is physically addicted, I don’t know. Probably. It’s just that I have no fucking reason to actually do it, physical-ly wise. Yes I am really, really sad but I don’t need it and I know that. 

Today I have decided this is where this fucking ends because for 6 MONTHS I have not been alive. I plan on going back to the gym and dedicating my time to that, no longer going out or drinking alcohol since that seems to always lead to one thing to the next, focusing on school, taking care of myself because I have SEVERALLY neglected myself during these few months, and just being a normal fucking human being again. 

I just hate this shame and guilt that I constantly have and it’s not coming from anyone else but myself and I think that is almost worse. I am keeping my own deepest darkest secret that is destroying me. I am so ashamed, disappointed, angry, and saddened by myself. Why do I hate myself so much and feel so much pain that this is what I have done to myself? 

Fuck cocaine. Fuck being a zombie. Today I am sober and I plan on living my life out that way. 

",22,8,1741414734.0,"Today I accepted the fact that I am addicted to cocaine, and I fucking hate myself. This is gonna be a long post. I have literally nowhere else to put my words though, none of my family or friends (besides the 1 friend who has occasionally done it with me, but to their knowledge does not know that I do it on my own constantly) know that I do cocaine almost daily and it is eating me alive.

It started out how it ‘usually does’ - few bumps maybe every couple of months or longer during special occasions, then a couple of months turned into every other weekend, especially when drinks were involved, to every other day after I got robbed in a city I’ve never been in before that set me off into the worst bipolar depressive episode I have ever had. 

I was doing SO fucking good before too. I had all of my bipolar meds that kept me steady, I became addicted to the gym and working out daily for hours straight, rarely drank alcohol - I looked fucking great too (because I was healthy lol) Then I decided to go to a music festival in a city 8 hours away that I have never been to before; my first solo trip… and then I got fucking robbed. All of my ID’s stolen (which sucked immensely because I drove there so the drive home was risky) and my credit card as well. I slept in a Denny’s parking lot for 3 hours to sober up off the few drinks I had in the festival and then drove home sobbing and feeling like a complete idiot. 

I don’t even really think it was the whole robbed thing that set off this horrid episode because when you have Bipolar, you know that what goes up absolutely comes crashing fucking down. I knew I was gonna crash, this robbing situation just accelerated it. 

I got super fucking depressed and suicidal, had an attempt on my own goddamn Bipolar medications - which led the hospital to completely cold turkey me off of every single one without the help of a psychiatrist (as he was on vacation during the time lol). To COLD TURKEY off of fucking anything that changes your brain’s chemicals is absolutely ass, I have absolutely never felt this way in my entire life. I literally feel like my soul left that day but my body is still here. Time doesn’t feel real - it’s Monday and then I lay in bed all day and suddenly it’s 3 fucking Mondays later. Literally everything is out of wack in my system, STILL. This robbing incident took place in July, it’s 8 months later and i’m still in this fucking depressive episode and on top of it, I forced my own self to confess that I have a pathetic issue with cocaine. 

I had enrolled in college and started in the end of September, but by this point I was so fucked up from the cold turkey meds situation that sleep was nonexistent to the point I was seeing shit and became super paranoid. I could barely wake up everyday for my 9 AM classes and even when I did, I would fall asleep during the entire class (can sleep anywhere else but in my own bed when I’m supposed to, I guess?) So I bought a bag of cocaine.

At first it was GREAT, I was able to go to class alert and actually participate in my course discussions, I didn’t feel so much anxiety while socializing in my class, and it didn’t matter if I was running on no sleep - I was awake. ‘I’ was in control of myself for the first time in months - no longer wasting the day in bed not knowing what time or actual day it was being a complete hermit. I was actually able to function. But then of course, it started to suck. Obviously coke fucks with your sleep and I already wasn’t sleeping, so I found myself bumping lines at 7 AM daily (even if there wasn’t class, just so I could get that alert, non-depressive fatigue feeling and clean my house fully, go to the grocery store, etc) all the way until 7 AM the next day. 

*It has been 6 months of this and I completely fucking hate myself.*

I don’t do it every single day, sometimes 2 days in a row, pause for 1 and then back again or 3 days without any and then the rest of the week I am a coked out loser. 

I am a VERY functional addict but obviously everyone could see a change in me, essentially rapid cycling through different emotions every single day (really depressed and quiet to happy and outgoing) but for the last few months, I haven’t been able to get that outgoing happy feeling from it, I just feel sad and anxious and I keep thinking of how fucking stupid I am. And how gross coke is. And how I am a ‘coke head’.

In 2017 after a break up, I sold a lucrative company (in Las Vegas) for $2.9M USD, I was 33 years old(I know I’m starting to sound Tacky; but this needs to be told for the rest of the story) 

I lost my house to my partner. (US laws can be damaging for a man) 

The first month of being “homeless” & “single”; 

I spent $150k USD on hotels, girls, partying, drinking, drugs-mostly weed & gambling) (Yes you read me right, $150k USD in one month) 

Thanks to one of my best friend who felt the downfall, he flew in from Europe; and dragged me to a “financial advisor” from a large & reputable investment firm. 

Both of them pretty much yelling at me on how stupid and dumb I was; and I’d be broke in 2 years, how lucky I was, people would dream to be in my situation etc etc (anyways you guys get the picture) 

I signed, & The firm locked me in for 45 years at a 1.8% yield “Very Low Risk” (they offer tiers Very low-Medium low- medium- etc etc ) with Cost of Living Adjustments increase, and increase on yearly interest payments (paid monthly) due to stocks rising, crypto rising, etc etc (I think my fund is invested in 3000 different companies, real estate, cryptos, bla bla bla) 

With a secured monthly payment and a nest egg; I decided to call myself “retired” and to start traveling all over the world; first Europe for 2 years and now Asia for the past 6 years. 

The addictions due to lack of “being busy” started pilling in. First cigarette chain smoking; and alcohol obviously followed. Asia got me addicted to women & Gambling. (easy access to women and easy access to Gambling since In Asia gambling is not thrown upon) 

Fast forward 8 years; I’m now 41 years old; alcoholic, Nicotine & Caffeine addict; women addict; and Gambling Addict. I gained about 35 pounds in those 8 years. I wear the same t-shirt everyday, my teeth are yellowish and my overall health is degrading rapidly. 

Im super kind and generous tho, and people tend to abuse of my generosity. 

I do live from paycheck to paycheck since I blow all my “interest” money on my addictions the first two weeks after getting my paycheck. 

I can call the investment firm and beg them; they’ll just tell me to tough it up until next payday (they’re used to clients like me) 

I have a total nomadic lifestyle- one bag, two shirts- two shorts- two pants - slippers and shoes- no socks no underwear. (Passport and Docs always with me) 
I go from hotels to hotels depending on my gambling and which women I will meet on that day. 

When I lose in gambling I always make sure to keep “just enough” for a small studio rental and food for the rest of the month. 

I feel like I have no use in life anymore, I tried to use that “interest” money for good causes.

 ie; Sunday feedings for street kids, dog shelters, basketball programs, chess clubs, free clinic day, but all the time there is abuse, corruption, or people just make  me feel like my “kindness” is considered as “weakness” 

I’m now in a bungalow house that I rented $100 USD for the month in the middle of nowhere on an island. 

I’m having such a hard time quitting smoking; 

yesterday i relapsed into drinking; I’m online 24/7 trying to plan my next set of girls for next month; and I’m not even thinking of quitting gambling.

I’ve done everything to from putting screen time limits and passwords on my phone and even had someone put a password on my phone to stop it. But I still crumble. I don’t know where or what else to do about it. The fact that I shelled out 200 in 10 min is not okay. Can’t do anything about it now. Any advice to keep me from watching porn would be much appreciated.,0.0,0.14201831783977775,Negative,Moderate Concern

1j2dhys,addiction,18 and mentally falling apart,"I’ll try and make this short for you. I stay with my grandparents because both my parents are addicts and so is everyone else in my family. Drugs inevitably became my autistic special interest at around 14, though for some reason id been wanting to try drugs since I was a little one. I started doing anything I could get my hands on when I was 15. I quickly realized opiates were my homegirl. After going through mini binges, getting expelled for doing/selling hard drugs at school twice in 6 months, and experimenting with literally every drug you can think of, and always falling back on opiates, i decided to quit when i started getting drug tested at my expulsion school. 

I was perfectly happy and clean for 10 months, improving every aspect of my life, until I was no longer drug tested and met a girl who ruined me. She got pregnant, and I started using painkillers and kratom again to ease the stress. I promised I would quit when she gave birth, but i ended up either being too high to go see her, or I was in withdrawal raging on her saying whatever I could to hurt her back. She had a miscarriage from presumably the stress. She blamed my drug use and anger, so I promised I’d quit when I turned 18. I started IVing coke a little right before my birthday, and ended up breaking up with her on my birthday. 

I stayed clean for a few days before attempting suicide. It failed, and I got super motivated and started manically improving my life. But after a month my old drug friends reached out to me and got me back in. I smoked crystal for the first time 2 weeks ago, I never liked stims except for when binging them, but meth seems to have done it for me

I’ve been more wreckless in the last two weeks than ever in my life. I’m horribly depressed when I’m not high, and have been doing meth and Xanax (which I just relapsed on) everyday/everyother day. My family is already aware I’m using something. I’ve been getting my straight edge friends into crystal, been going to school high occasionally, have only been getting 1-5 hours sleep a night for the last 9 days, have been completely losing my mind, been giving myself anticholinergic poisoning mixed with meth so I can sleep + not know if I’ll wake up in the morning, I’ve been burning bridges with people by texting crazy shit at 3am. I told myself id quit after this bag, but just picked up more tonight. I took acid last night to reset my brain, and messaged everyone not to sell to me, but I’ve already given up on that. 

I’m trying to see a therapist and get on psychiatric meds because I’m not mentally okay. I lied and told them I don’t use and I’m not depressed. But I’ve been going through episodes since I was little, and it always ends in drug binges and/or half-assed suicide attempts. I’m dysfunctional due to social anxiety and depression, and staying at home getting high has become my reward system and only life. I want so badly to forget about crystal meth, opiates, and stick to weed and psychs. I know I can because when I was expelled and drug tested, I was happier than in a long time. 

So what can I do at this point, what efforts or changes to my mindset, small tasks, anything would move me towards being happy. I think other than meth and opiates a little, I’m not too addicted, just drugs are my special interest and am used to using as a crutch for stress.

**TL:DR** 
Drugs are my autistic special interest. Been using for 3 years since I was 15. Keep promising I’m gonna quit, but get interested in experimenting with a new drug I haven’t tried then get addicted. Went from smart-class nerdy student, to expelled twice and at a continuation school.

3+ years of daily stimulant use. 
Methylphenidate for 3 years, cocaine for 1.5 years, both together for 1 year. I live to be high, and I’ve known for a while now. I’m an addict and have became very aware of this. 

I love altering my mind; psychedelics, dissociatives, cannabis, the occasional benzo…. You name it.

This all started 9+ years ago after a breakup. Tried coke, loved it, and within days I was buying in bulk. Quickly spiraled into heavy daily use, 2+ grams a day. My first wake-up call was showing up to a family Christmas completely blitzed. Got clean for almost 3 years.

Relapsed. Started as occasional weekends, then a 2 gram binge that left me wondering if I was OD’ing. Continued using regularly but told myself I wasn’t addicted because it wasn’t daily.

Then came an ADHD diagnosis, leading to a Ritalin prescription. I swapped one addiction for another… gradually increasing my dose until I was taking 120mg daily.

Cocaine came back into my life 18 months ago. Everyone around me did it, it was available, and just like that, I was daily again… a gram or more a day.

Last week, I managed 10 days off coke, but only by leaning harder on Ritalin.

I’ve promised myself I’d quit countless times, but the cycle repeats. It’s tied to everything in my life; meals, errands, chores. I can’t function without that dopamine hit, and I’m exhausted.

I’m emotionally self-aware, I hold myself as accountable as I can, but I’m beat down. Distant from people, ghosting texts, stuck in depressive funks, paranoid, impulsive, undisciplined.

It was an accidental overdose.. she told me she was taking drugs and gave me her apartment number @ 1:58 AM and when she didn’t respond , I just thought she got into it with her girlfriend and was sleeping it off because that wasn’t unusual for her. Had the cops sent to their apartment for a wellfare check in the morning because she wouldn’t respond to me..but I made it seem like she was suicidal thinking they’d have to enter if nobody answered the door.

1iwj8sy,addiction,all i think about is how much i want xanax,"all my life i have battled with drugs off all kinds. but xanax was the one that always had my heart. 

i’ve been off xanax for 4 months now. last year, i was using xanax for most of the year. i had relapsed again and it was bad. i was taking so many bars a day, i couldn’t even put a number on it. 

in october, i was driving home from work and kept nodding off. i would wake up on the highway, going 70mph, swerving in between lanes. i didn’t pull over, i just kept waking up, slapping myself thinking i would keep my eyes open this time. well, the last time i nodded off, i didn’t wake up until i had flipped my car four times. i gained consciousness during the last 2 flips of the car. i was upside down but managed to unbuckle my seatbelt. luckily, the windshield was smashed, so i crawled through there while the car caught on fire. 

i couldn’t walk. i could barely move. when i got to the hospital, they told me i fractured my spine, ribs, sternum, and hips. i shattered the heel in my right foot and broke my ankle. i totaled my car, no insurance (i let my insurance lapse because i was dumb as fuck and barely conscious most of the time), i lost my job, i lost my apartment, i lost everything. 

so four months go by, im still not walking due to a complication with my foot surgery. i’m not really doing anything at all, besides sitting at home thinking about all that i could’ve done differently. but my frustration lies with my addiction, because despite all that xanax has brought upon my life, i want it back. 

i want it back more than anything. i would trade all the help i am receiving from my friends and family, the help that’s kept a new roof over my head and my belly full, the help that keeps my insurance paid so i can see doctors, the help that gives me support in life, i would trade it all if i could have xanax back in my life. 

do you hear how selfish that sounds? it’s disgusting, i know. i hate it. i hate that im like this. but on the same note, i also do not care. every day, i think about xanax. how good it made me feel. how it changed how i viewed myself and the confidence it gave me. how complete i was when i had it. i didn’t need a boyfriend, or friends, or support, or food in my stomach, or a job that kept me distracted. i felt like i had everything in the world when i had xanax. 

why, after all of this, all of the years of relapse, almost fucking dying in a car fire, losing my job, finding myself in debt $30,000 because i can’t pay any of my bills anymore and still owe on the car, no longer able to walk normally, everything that offered some sense of security in my life just ripped from my hands, why would i want the thing that irreversibly ruined my life? why can’t i let it go? why do i feel like i absolutely need it to survive? 

i thought that the universe was offering a second chance when i woke up from that car accident. the fact that i woke up at all in time to escape the car is a miracle. i’ve thought about all the reasons why what has happened to me, happened. and it’s all because i let my addiction spiral again. it’s all my fault, i know. but it’s all because i was on xanax. so shouldn’t i hate the drug that caused me so much suffering? 

i’ve been racking my brain trying to think of someone i can hit up who might sell it. i’m worried i’ll buy something pressed with fent. but im willing to take that chance, just to feel it again. the little money i have saved, i’ll spend it on xanax. but before i go too far, i just want to hear what you guys have to say. something to talk me off the ledge, because i know what i want to do is wrong. i know there’s a chance of me relapsing again and possibly dying. 

i know there’s a part of me that wants to beat this. but right now, that’s not the part of me i’m in touch with. please help me.

1ivyfq0,addiction,Long Term Ketamine Abuse,"For starters, I’m in my early 20’s currently. Over the past two years I have struggled with severe Ketamine abuse, on multiple occasions to the point of unbearable physical pain (stomach cramping and bladder) which has put me in urgent cares and the ER on multiple occasions. It started while I was recovering from Cocaine addiction, it had the opposite effect on me which I enjoyed and I was still able to fill my nasal fixation. I had been kicked out of my home and while having significant savings, was unable to find housing for a long while. During that period alone I spent over half of my remaining savings on Ket, days blurring together and my bank account going unchecked as I continued to pick up more and more, even staying at my at the time plugs house overnight on occasion high off my ass. I ended up finding a place to stay, but being away from my family only made it easier to keep consuming more. I progressed into bulk buying after retaining a job for a while, which is when I started doing it to a completely vile extent (this is well over a year ago) and ended up with severe cramping and bladder issues. I continued using it throughout due to thinking the ket subdued the pain and it was from something else (it obviously wasn’t). After realizing where the issues stemmed from I significantly lowered my usage for a moth or two, still using around a gram a day which shockingly was minimal for me. A few months ago I managed to go two weeks sober, which I did solely to pass a drug test for a new job. After getting the job I relapsed, spending more and more again and getting to the point where I’d leave work to go pick up and get high. I ended up losing that job likely due the absences and have been without stable work ever since, still managing to get high almost every day down to my last penny. Nearing the end of this month I have $1 to my name, my monthly spend for ketamine being nearly double what I pay for rent. As much as I can bear to go without it, I am in such close quarters with the ability to keep abusing it. 4+ plugs within a 15 min radius, one of which living walking distance. No matter what time of day or night, I know I can get it from one of them. This cycle has ruined a lot of things in my life, and in that regard only I am to blame. Dishonesty, hiding away in my room and away from these issues, and never going to the meetings people forward to me.

Backstory: I'm on a sober journey from alcohol. He's been super supportive, especially as he only drinks rarely. Also of note: he's from Italy and he's been in the country for 25 years.

Last week I relapsed and drank a bottle of red wine we had in the house - Valpolicella, probably $10 from Trader Joe's. He knew this, I felt guilty and awful about it happening at all. I don't remember if I finished the bottle (probably) or if I put the partial bottle somewhere. He asks me about it the next day. I genuinely don't remember. The line of questioning made me feel guilty and uncomfortable. Fast forward to tonight he asks me where the bottle of red wine is and I'm like what? And he said the one from last week that was already open. I said I have no idea. Then 5 minutes later he says ""what should I drink?"" and I say ""whatever you want"", and he says he feels like Valpolicella. I gesture towards the cabinet and ask if he wants me to see if we have any and he kind of chuckles and says no.

At that point I'm furious and feel ashamed so I say I'm done and walk away. He comes into the bedroom to ask why I'm so upset. The subsequent conversation was pointless. He claims he doesn't know and said ""was it about the wine?"". YES, it was about the wine. Why did he insist on making me feel like shit over and over again? To bring it up 3 times? I asked why he insisted on making me feel like shit about this. He played dumb. He said ""I'm sorry you're so easily offended"".

It's no secret I slipped up last week but I don't remember. There's no purposeful withholding of information about this potential partial bottle of wine.

I feel so many things I don't know where to start. The disrespect, the guilt, the shaming, the blame, the insistence that he has NO IDEA why I'd be upset. I'm at a loss for words and can't see this situation clearly. Thank you for reading.",0,4,1740252934.0,"Shamed by Partner Me: 47F, Him: 56M.

1ivklon,addiction,I feel like I will never get over my ketamine addiction,"I started first during summer 2024 during free parties expecting it to not be worse than mdma or weed, except I quickly realise that I really wanted more, unlike anything I ever felt . I took some again until I ended in a psychiatric hospital for other reasons.

My stay a the clinic was pretty traumatizing, especially since I was trans but not officially yet. I basically came out of the clinic worse than when I entered, in order to be prepared for my entrance in an art school I was very excited about. At the same time my girlfriend, who I was very attractive to broke up with me. Then I had to move to a different city in which I didn’t know anybody.

I took some again until I ended in a psychiatric hospital for other reasons.

My stay a the clinic was pretty traumatizing, especially since I was trans but not officially yet. I basically came out of the clinic worse than when I entered, in order to be prepared for my entrance in an art school I was very excited about. At the same time my girlfriend, who I was very attractive to broke up with me. Then I had to move to a different city in which I didn’t know anybody.

1iuessm,addiction,[ADVICE NEEDED] I Finally Kicked Out the Tweaker on My Couch—Now I Need to Save Myself (throwaway for obvious reasons),"Alright, Reddit. I need real advice from people who’ve been where I am. Not judgment, not “you should’ve known better” (trust me, I know), just real talk.

I’m Amelia. 38. Single mom. Full-time massage therapist, part-time disaster artist. I live in a trailer about 20 minutes outside Sandy, Oregon, which is to say, the middle of nowhere. If you picture a dirt road, a rusted-out pickup in the yard, and a sky so dark at night it makes you feel small, you’re getting close.

It’s just me and my son Wyatt—now.

Up until last week, there was Dane.

I need to be clear: Dane wasn’t really my boyfriend. I mean, yeah, we slept together, but that was more about needing somebody than any actual feelings. He was just this lost, broken person I thought I could help.

See, a few months ago, he got robbed. Stripped down to nothing. He was shaky, paranoid, desperate. And I know that look. I’ve had that look. So, I did what I always do—I let him in.

And that was my first mistake.

Because Dane? He wasn’t just down on his luck. He was gone. His brain was fried from whatever poison he was putting in his veins. He’d go days without sleeping, pacing like an animal, laughing at nothing. Some nights, I’d wake up to find him standing in the doorway, just watching me sleep. Other times, he’d talk about how “they” were coming. No explanation. No context. Just they.

And yet—I still let it go on.

Because deep down, I know why I let him stay.

It’s the same reason I let my own demons back in every time I swear I won’t.

Because that monkey on my back? It never really left.

Yeah, I don’t use like I used to. I don’t let it wreck my life anymore. But every single day is a fight, and some days, it takes everything I have just to get through. I still hear it whispering, still feel it pulling, especially when I’m exhausted, when my bones hurt, when life feels like too much.

And having Dane around?

It was like watching a ghost of myself.

But even when I wanted to help him, I couldn’t. Because he didn’t want help. He just wanted a place to crash, a safe spot to fall apart, and someone stupid enough to keep the lights on for him.

And then, he sold my air fryer.

That was it. That was the final straw. Not the sleepless nights. Not the missing cash. The goddamn air fryer.

I told him to get out. He just laughed. That slow, creepy, not-all-there laugh. And I knew—right then—that I wasn’t looking at a person anymore.

I was looking at what’s waiting for me if I ever lose this fight.

So, I packed his shit, threw it out the door, and locked it behind him. He yelled. He begged. He threatened. But I didn’t open it. Not this time.

And now?

It’s just me and Wyatt. And for the first time in a long time, I feel like I have a chance.

But I don’t know where to go from here.

I don’t just need to fix my life—I need to fix me.

I need to get out of this town. I need to build a life that isn’t just survival mode. I need to prove to my kid that I’m not just white-knuckling my way through this, that I can be solid for him.

I’m exhausted. But I’m not giving up.

So, Reddit—how do you actually rebuild when you’re starting from nothing? How do you go from barely hanging on to actually living again?

TL;DR: Kicked out a tweaker I should’ve never let stay. Now I need to save myself before I end up right where he is. Where do I start?

1iuaekt,addiction,"My loved one relapsed after three months sober, need advice","Context : Me (21, f) and my bf (20,m) stayed sober from 27 october 2024. We used to be hardcore drug addicts in our past and we decided that we quit after we got together. We did drugs a couple times at the beginning of our relationship and then slowly got rid of those things, we stopped going to parties, stopped talking to people who still use and we didn’t feel the need of doing drugs again. 

Recently life got a little tough, he got two jobs(barista & dj), moved by himself and I noticed he started getting distant from me. I always go see him, check on him and offer him all my love and support. 
Yesterday after I went to his place to hang out a little, I went home, everything seemed fine.
Today he came to my place, we got into a little fight because I told him I felt “something’s off” and he told me he did drugs all night. 
I couldn’t believe it, I was very disappointed and confused. I really want to save him because I don’t want addiction to take him again…
He said that he did it because he feels lonely and stressed out lately and wants to move together with me .

1iu4sae,addiction,My Best Friend Has Been a Heroin User for 10 plus Years—Looking for Real Advice and help.,"She is honestly one of the most loving, caring, and selfless people I have ever known. She’s been a functioning heroin user for 10 plus years—early 30s, smoker, pays all her bills, and takes care of everything, including raising her daughter (who just left for college). She’s never once asked me or anyone else for anything, her family asks her for stuff All the time and depends on her plus she has animals she takes care of too so she’s always busy but then at the same time her family gives her shit constantly  because of her addiction and it’s just became a loop and because of her use, her health has suffered over the years too. 

The most recent issue has been with her throat—she hasn’t been able to eat solids for six months, and they had to stretch her throat. She’s had liver problems before and gets really sick whenever anything hits her. The sad part is that she’s still beautiful, incredibly creative, funny and full of ideas, but she isolates herself completely. She refuses relationships because she says she doesn’t want to drag anyone down. Whenever I ever go with her to doctor’s appointments they make her feel like an addict I’ve literally watched a doctor say he wouldn’t help because she is an addict. She has terrible anxiety and everyone just expects her to fix it. 

She’s tried to get sober before, but when she did, she said time slowed down —minutes felt like hours, and she had no new routine to fill the void. She relapsed. Today, she took the step to try methadone.

She can’t afford inpatient treatment, and no one in her support circle (including me) has that kind of money. I’ve looked into all these “state-of-the-art biohacking” places that claim guaranteed results, but what I really need is real advice from people who have actually made it through this or helped someone who has.

What has actually worked? What recovery paths have kept someone sober long-term?. I’ve lost most of my family to addiction, and I don’t want to see her go down the same path when she still has so much life left to live.

1isef3r,addiction,"My (30) fiance (27) overdosed and passed away, please help me understand what was going on with him.","Hi, this is going to be a painful story for me to share, but I'm really struggling to put together the pieces of the last few months before my fiance (Nicholas) passed away. We have a daughter (May) who is only 9 months old. Nicholas had struggled with addiction for many years and passed away a month ago. I am beyond heartbroken, I'm feeling 100 feelings at once, but I'm doing what I can to be the best Mom I can for May.

I understand addiction is a disease, it's not the addiction in itself that I need clarity on, but the symptoms of his using and his behaviors in the last few months before he died leave me with a lot of questions about what he was using and what was going on with his mental state. I'm hoping maybe someone can shed some light on the events leading up to his death.

Nicholas was an amazing Dad when May was born. He was helpful, he loved to cuddle her and play songs for her on her guitar. When she was 2-3 months old, something changed. He started to have extreme delusions and paranoia. For a few months he had been working on solving the Riemann hypothesis--it started as just something he'd do in his spare time (he was really smart and good at math), but then became obsessive. He would try to talk to me about it for hours, eventually getting to the point where he believed he created a quantum computer that could explain time and space. When I couldn't pay attention (because I was taking care of a newborn) he would get extremely irritated. 

He stopped helping with May completely, we were living on the opposite coast of both of our families, so I was working full-time from home and taking care of our daughter 24/7 by myself. Nicholas had other delusions as well--he was working as a substance abuse counselor for veterans and started to believe the hospital was doing experiments on the clients. He ended up losing that job and got a different one working for a non-profit that was supposed to be helping flood victims--then he started thinking there was a major flood coming that the government knew about and was hiding from us.

Nicholas got paranoid about his family, he stopped talking to them and told me a bunch of different things--that he had a secret twin, that his Dad had been secretly selling his protected health information since he was born, etc. He wanted to uninvite them all from our wedding. Nicholas had sores on his face, on his arms, and would tell me he had an incurable disease. He refused to see a doctor, he refused to see a psychiatrist. I asked him to take a drug test multiple times and he would brush it off.

I tried so hard to get him to get help, to go to treatment, to tell me what was going on. The worst of the delusions was that he started to believe I was hurting our daughter--this is what ultimately led me to leave him and move back in with my parents when she was 5 months old. This is really hard for me to talk about but I feel like it's important. It started when he was watching me on the baby monitor, I had just tried to put her to sleep (she wasn't having it) and when I came out with her he took her from me and started screaming ""What were you doing to her arm!"" but I hadn't done anything...I knew at that point he was on something so I called our parents on speaker phone and got him to give her back to me and made him leave the apartment. We talked about it and he apologized, said it wouldn't happen again, that he was just a nervous Dad, promised to get therapy and see a psychiatrist. Then a few weeks later, he followed me into the nursery while I was putting her to sleep (it was pitch black in there) and she was breastfeeding and just nodding off on my lap and he started touching her body, touching my arms, and then out of nowhere screamed ""What are you doing to her legs! She has no muscle tonality in her legs!"". I knew it was happening again so I got up, went to the living room, called my Mom, and just kept telling him to leave. He kept trying to take her from me but I just held on as tight as I could, but he would scream ""You're holding her too tight! Don't walk on the tile you're going to drop her!"" It was the most horrible, terrifying, traumatic incident of my life and the next day I my Dad fly out and he helped me move home with my daughter. Nicholas' Mom also flew out and was there to help him go to treatment, but he refused. Throughout all of this I had called the police multiple times, the final time they were able to get him sent to the psych ward but he left within hours of being there and walked miles with no shoes on back to our apartment. 

After I moved home, I convinced him to move back in with his family which is in a different state than where I am but on the same coast. He got a job working at a restaurant. He would call me often and would tell me he knows I wouldn't hurt May, that he was sorry, but I still felt like something was off. He wouldn't tell me what happened beyond that he took something ""a few times"" and had ""post-acute stress disorder."" But I couldn't let him back into our lives until I knew what had happened and that he had gotten help, was on meds, was in AA, etc. From what he was telling me he was doing good, but I couldn't trust him and I didn't believe that he was sober. He overdosed about a month after he moved home--the police confiscated 2 bags of white powder and I saw pictures of what looked like cocaine residue on his desk but the autopsy results still haven't come back yet.

I guess what I'm looking for here is for someone to tell me what he may have been using and if what I described sounds like psychosis? Or some kind of schizo-affective disorder? I had seen Nicholas when he was using over the years, he primarily relapsed on opiates, but what I saw after our daughter was born was not the same. He was a completely different person. When he was talking about his delusions, he 100% believed them. He would look at me and I knew he believed 100% that I was hurting May and that was the scariest, saddest part for me. 

I really, really loved him and to watch him turn into someone I didn't know right before my eyes was horrible. I am so sad for myself, his family, and most of all our daughter. I am angry at him, so angry, and I just want to understand what he was going through and how he got so far away from the Nicholas I agreed to marry and have a baby with.

1irz09a,addiction,My mom relapsed with her drinking again…,"For context and backstory, my mom started drinking heavily a few years ago. It started with a few drinks on the weekends and slowly got worse over the years. Within the past couple years is when it got really bad. She has Crohn’s disease, but she would drink herself into oblivion off vodka to the point she would use the bathroom on herself and get incredibly sick and have to lay down and go to sleep. Then as soon as she was awake again, she would repeat the cycle. It got to the point where she would get hammered at work and leave early or just not show up to begin with. She eventually gave herself pancreatitis back to back and had to get her gallbladder removed because it was full of black sledge. After multiple attempts at drilling it into her head that she’s killing herself and her relationship with her family(angrily, calmly, informatively, I tried it all), I got the rest of the family involved and told them what was going on. We had an intervention set up, then she disappeared the day it was going to happen. A few days later is when I heard she was in rehab. She stayed a couple months, detoxed, and even started going to NA. I was proud of her, truly. Today I was at my parents house in their bathroom, I pulled a towel down from the highest rack and out came 3 vodka shooters. I knew she’d been acting really strangely again lately, but this was heartbreaking to find. She gets spacey, her short term memory is almost gone completed, she gets fired up and starts cussing like a sailor (out of character for her), and she gets sick to the point of having to lay down and sleep it off. Overall, she gives up on everything and you can see it in her hygiene. She “retired” recently (basically just stopped going in to work and saying she’s gonna start withdrawing social security), but I see her spiraling again. If she gets how she was the past time, she’s not gonna last another 5 years. 

I haven’t done anything about the vodka shooters I found stashed away yet. And I don’t know what I should do. She doesn’t have an income to go back to rehab this time, and I don’t know if my dad even knows at this point yet. Should I tell him, my siblings, the rest of the family? Should I give up on it? I told my girlfriend, and she told me I should leave it alone this time since she’s so content on her drinking and can’t be trusted to stay sober on her own clearly. To an extent, I agree that there’s nothing I can do. But it’s hard to watch my mother slowly deteriorate and just let it happen. I understand wanting a few drinks and turning up every so often, but this is beyond normal help. She has no self control or moderation whatsoever. It’s literally killing her from the inside, and I don’t think she’s seeing it that way. 

Sorry for the incredibly long rant guys, but I’m so disappointed and depressed over this situation. She’s chosen the alcohol over and over again, and I don’t know how much more I can take. Does anyone have any advice for this situation? Anything helps.

1irb3y8,addiction,"I’m 20 years old with a cocaine addiction, just relapsed and looking for help","Hello everyone,
 
this is my story, I am looking for help how to quit this shit and get back on my feet. If you have any tips and methods if you wouldn’t mind, please let me know. I’m not looking for a long paragraph or someone spilled their heart out or waste anybody’s time i’m just a random guy struggling and looking for some guidance.

How it all started,

I was still 19 at the time I went on a camping trip with a couple of buddies, and we took a boat out to the spot when I got off the boat, I hope to unload everything set up the tent and then one of my buddies came over pulled out. His cigarettes opened them, and there was a baggie of cocaine and he said later, if you wanna try some, you can so I said yeah anyway later that night we were all drunk and I didn’t know how to take cocaine at the time I didn’t barely know what it was so he showed me how to cut it up and put it back in a baggie and just use your key to take a little bump and that you could grab some with your finger and rub it on your gums and it will make them numb anyways long story short I tried it and I loved it. I texted one of my old weed dealers and he had some Coke that I could buy, and I have just been buying from him ever since about 2 8balls a week for about three months I tried to quit a week ago and honestly, it wasn’t even that bad. I didn’t feel down or nothing but that also could be because I drink a lot and I also smoke. But I’m not sure anyways I was drinking last night and I texted my dealer asking if could get another 8ball and I about blue through half of it today still snorting lines and taking bumps as I am currently writing this and it’s crazy because the only time I ever feel like writing about my problem or feeling like I should stop is when I’m using I use it at work because I’ll be tired from the night before. I work on a construction site a big construction site and I also don’t think that it’s safe that I’m using on the job. 

The thing I can’t get over Is that I know that it’s bad for me, I know that I need to quit, I don’t wanna do this shit anymore. It makes me feel like shit in the mornings and after using trying to fall asleep so that I can get up for work in the morning. Feeling tired all the time and then having to use just to feel awake and alive. I don’t know how to stop this mess. It went fine for that week, but I feel like last night. I felt like it was a reward or something which it’s not, but it felt that way I want to change my mindset and fix this stupid problem. 

That’s really all just same old shit, I am sorry if I didn’t put into words very well what I was trying to say. I could’ve gone into more detail, but I know that people aren’t gonna read a lot, but you got the gist of it so if you have anything to say, please let me know. I would really appreciate it.

I also wanna add that. I am in a lot of debt for a 20-year-old if you guys have any tips on saving and investing.

the program is 6 months, 5 days a week and very intensive and stressful. im doing well so far because i take 50mg unprescribed vyvanse every day and its helping me a lot, except its fucking up my sleep.

i've been a pretty heavy ketamine user for a while and since my partner left and im alone again it turned into daily use. i had to stop because i hit the tolerence ceiling and it was just constant headaches and weird symptoms like random noises sounding metallic. rough comedowns and also horrible sleep. i wanted to take a tolerence break but i couldn't deal with it anymore so i relapsed into xanax.

i didnt want to ruin my life again but now im doing pills every day and drinking at the same time. i've been bumping my head on furniture and hurting my neck because i sleep weird.i forget to take my meds. if i keep this up and fail school i think its over for me.

i cant go to detox because of my school schedule. i don't know what to do and im scared. i also feel petty because i think i should be able to deal with this on my own but i dont know how. i can't tell anyone about this.

I was on a bender for 3 days. Mostly benzos mixed with alcohol. And food. Anorexia at a young age led me to a severe BED so my brain associated benders with “eat all you can because then you’ll get better and you won’t be able to do it again”.

I go to the shop I buy shit. Disgusting food, I look homeless, unwashed hair, haven’t showered for two weeks. Ive had depression episodes for various reasons. Unresolved trauma, addictions I struggle with everyday and dealing with my no will to live. Eventually I relapse and turn into a homeless, disgusting person. People give me the looks of disgust.

But I’ll get sober in a few days. I’ll have a job interview, make myself super presentable (believing that the bender won’t happen again), maybe will even get the job.

And people are disgusted to stand next to me on public transport AGAIN and im not exaggerating I’ve heard whispers of people talking about me in pure repulsion.

I've blown all my chances, money, been to like 15 rehabs, I have serious nerve damage still in my feet.

I don't know what I'm writing for. Just a cautionary tale to those younger than me. Drugs will screw up your life and at a certain point a ""comeback"" is unlikely. 

I stop nitrous tomorrow, like a two month $20k relapse. I need to fight. I feel brain dead. ☠️  horrible tinnitus, anxiety, anhedonia, no energy , from the nitrous - Steve O will concur that shit is like one of the worst drugs out there. Meth is almost safer.

It's not, I need to clean it up, I'm due a big tax refund so once I get that I can setup. I think in a few weeks of no nitrous or other drugs I'll start coming back online.

I took my own recovery a little more seriously after that.

When I walked in to do my first group, there he was. Back in the program. He had his struggles of course and landed himself back in there. But, this time he was talking the talk and walking the walk. He had a good number of sober days under his belt, and he told me about his goal of opening a sober living house. He made his hobby his new business and was thriving. He was doing amazing.

1in7wqa,addiction,"Girlfriend been sober for almost 4 years, relapsed into drugs yesterday not sure how to cope","Ok first time dealing with this scenario and this is on a secondary account so there’s nothing to tie it back to anyone, it’s a long long story and names changed.

So i met my current girlfriend let’s call her Jane at work. I know, I know i’ll already catch hell from folks who say don’t date coworkers but what’s done is done. I noticed her right off the bat my first day on the job she had been here about 3 years. We easily became friends often being assigned the same areas to work in, we had lots in common. Nothing relationship wise developed for about 8 months into my being there.

Jane was previously married to an asshole named Jake for recap purposes. She was still in the process of getting the court to complete their divorce she had been married to him about a year and found out he had been cheating on her their entire marriage hence the divorce. She no longer speaks to Jake and their divorce is finally done. Prior to marrying Jake she was in a relationship with an obviously now ex boyfriend John which is were the story really takes a start.

John got Jane hooked on a variety of drugs. From what she’s told me coke and heroin. She has a now almost 5 year old son Thomas that John is the father of. John was a dealer and at times forced Jane to deal as well until he started abusing her and she left him. Once she found out she was pregnant she became homeless, due to living with her parents they kicked her out on the streets. She held down a job and finished school while still pregnant at the time. To help make ends meet she did for a very short while turn to prostitution which did not last long.

She kicked the drug habit long before Thomas was born and had been clean since so about 4 ish years. Recently however life’s been rough on her losing family members, pets and a close best friend.

She would tell me when she’d want to try to use and she’d always promise she wouldn’t, for me for her kid etc

Then today she drops a bombshell that she used yesterday. A few bumps of coke, the depression of all the real life events hitting her in a short amount of time had made her feel numb to the world she says.

So i met my current girlfriend let’s call her Jane at work. I know, I know i’ll already catch hell from folks who say don’t date coworkers but what’s done is done. I noticed her right off the bat my first day on the job she had been here about 3 years. We easily became friends often being assigned the same areas to work in, we had lots in common. Nothing relationship wise developed for about 8 months into my being there.

Jane was previously married to an asshole named Jake for recap purposes. She was still in the process of getting the court to complete their divorce she had been married to him about a year and found out he had been cheating on her their entire marriage hence the divorce. She no longer speaks to Jake and their divorce is finally done. Prior to marrying Jake she was in a relationship with an obviously now ex boyfriend John which is were the story really takes a start.

John got Jane hooked on a variety of drugs. From what she’s told me coke and heroin. She has a now almost 5 year old son Thomas that John is the father of. John was a dealer and at times forced Jane to deal as well until he started abusing her and she left him. Once she found out she was pregnant she became homeless, due to living with her parents they kicked her out on the streets. She held down a job and finished school while still pregnant at the time. To help make ends meet she did for a very short while turn to prostitution which did not last long.

She kicked the drug habit long before Thomas was born and had been clean since so about 4 ish years. Recently however life’s been rough on her losing family members, pets and a close best friend. 

Up till yesterday I’d been able to support her thru everything. Constant reassurance, always being there for her, helping her financially cause our jobs don’t pay a lot etc and she’s done good.

1imgsvo,addiction,Friend with drug dependency on involuntary hold for drug-induced psychosis discharged early while still in psychosis with ZERO aftercare- what more can be done?,"After three years of drug dependency (weed, kratom, cocaine, adderall, DMT, shrooms, acid), close friend has been in extreme drug-induced psychosis for two months. Totally disconnected from reality, speaking to spirits he believes are real and that he is the master of the universe. Spent two months trying to get him help, involving everyone we could, parents spent 10k+ they didn't have on interventionists, until finally he admitted the spirits had told him to kill himself, that he had avoided seeing friends because he ""wasn't sure what the spirits would make him do,"" and described instances where the spirits had controlled his body by forcing him not to urinate for hours while being in pain.

This was finally enough to call EMS and he was put on an involuntary hold 10 days ago.

While there, he was put on anti-psychotics but psychiatrist spent almost no time with him. No one conveyed to his parents that the hold could be up to 60 days, so they were desperately looking for care thinking he would be discharged soon. Social worker pushed a program he was not qualified for; he agreed to to intake but once not accepted (he wasn't qualified) became very upset and has refused any other treatment. Since social worker had mentioned an outpatient program to him, he was no longer on an involuntary hold and had to be discharged. I went and saw him last night to try to convince him to do an outpatient program. He is clearly still in psychosis, said he wasn't hearing voices currently but still referenced spirits. Denied any drug use from last two months (a lie) and denied anything he said about suicidal voices (a lie). When we expressed everyone in his life was concerned for him, was totally disconnected from processing this and said the last two months have been some of the best of his life, that nothing is wrong with him and he is better than ever. Extremely defensive and not budging at all with idea that anything could be wrong with him at all, anyone expressing concern is 100% wrong.

This morning he was discharged without ANY AFTERCARE. Not even a further psychiatrist or therapist appointment set up by the hospital. He gave dad permission to see his drug test records, but hospital was clearly in a rush to discharge him and said Dad could view at home, which I'm assuming our friend won't allow once they leave the hospital. Dad wanted to ask hospital about getting him an injection of anti-psychotics before leaving since we assume he will stop taking medication, but hospital gave no time to ask and shepherded them out with no instructions and nothing but a month prescription of anti-psychotics. Hospital couldn't tell anyone if he is schizoprenic/bipolar/etc, and friend will never tell us so we are totally in the dark about his mental state.

Friend is now back home with NO SUPPORT LINED UP still in psychosis in filthy room with windows boarded up and spray paint covering every wall. He will definitely immediately stop taking his medicine and go back to taking drugs. However now will never admit again to dangerous thoughts since that's what landed him in the psych ward, so he is in even more danger because he will now not share with us. I am sure that if the spirits told him to jump in front of a train he would do it.

Is this completely unethical of the hospital? What can be done next? At a complete loss, devastated by hospital's mistake with discharge and suggesting a program that would never take him as our one shot at getting him help. Family's resources are gone, everyone is exhausted and doesn't know where to begin with even just finding him a basic psychiatrist. Friend's dependency is not only on drugs but love of psychosis itself. Needs intensive care. Should his two roommates say he has to move out unless he gets care? Should friends say they will stop being his friend unless he gets care? Don't want to alienate him and leave him with no one.

He is my best friend. Spending time with him is so traumatic and I don't know how long I can keep doing it, but I can't give up on him. Feel unsafe at times spending time with him as the spirits have told him we are soulmates (we used to date in real life) and I worry in any moment the spirit's perception of me could become negative.

After first bout of psychosis that he came out of naturally somehow in December, committed himself to going to NA, admitted to drug problem, started intake at an outpatient program and seemed like himself. But it was the holidays, all support took a few weeks to get started, and within a few days he used and re-entered extreme psychosis.

1ikr5w3,addiction,i am not sure if i am relapsed,"i am not sure if i am relapsed.

After 5 month total sobriety i had a mental break down.

My doctor told me i would have a burnout and to take anti-depressions and i told her i don't want to take them. I would rather start smoking weed again.

She just looked at me and basically agreed with me.

She just said ""thats a way too"".

What i did not told her is, that weed is part of my addiction history.

So started to smoke weed again. Last week.

And i will not lye. It worked in that moment and was good for my mental breakdown.

But nevertheless it was not my plan to smoke pot again and it feels like cheating. Even if my doctor told me to do it.

The good part of the story is I did not relapse on the stupid shit. (Alcohol, tobacco, Speed, mdma, you name it).

And i really dont want to take anti-depressions.

1ij0bwj,addiction,NAC saved me from addiction (so far 45 days clean) My cravings are now non-existent.,"I'm 45 days clean. To be clear, I am addicted, I was twice in rehab. Polydrug addict, did hard shit like meth, speed, but also alcohol and kratom. Different episodes with differnt DOC. With first rehab I was 7 months clean, but it was very difficult and I relapsed in depressive episode. After second rehab I relapsed 3rd week I got out.

Now I am able to stay clean without the rehab. I take 2000mg NAC split in two doses. It started to do the trick in a week or two. 4 weeks in and my cravings are non-existent. It's so amazing I am sharing it everywhere. If I would know NAC 2 years ago I would not fall into hard drugs addiction and i would not have to go through 2 rehabs, toxic psychosis and my I would not have lost years of my life battleing addiction.

100% recommend anyone who is addicted to drugs! It's such a pity that I didn't found this earlier. But better late than never.

Of course that when I feel bad i know that few beers would make me feel better, but it's not a craving. No compulsion to drink or use, I don't have to fight the urges anymore. My cravings at this point are non-existent.

several months ago i got really bad pain in my lungs from vaping. it got to the point that breathing was agonizing and i couldn't lay down. i was pretty much forced to quit vaping because it was so bad i couldn't even function or go to work.

i did not vape for two months, the first of which i used nicotine patches and gum, which helped a lot. however, about a month ago i started again, because my cravings were so bad. now for the past week i have been having weird feelings in my throat. there is a constant feeling that something is stuck in my throat, and there's painful clicking every time i swallow, which has made eating and drinking difficult. additionally, i'm always coughing. i've gone to the doctor, and there's nothing ""wrong"" with me, i'm not sick or anything. i'm pretty certain that vaping is the cause, because when i don't do it for a little while my symptoms improve, but come back as soon as i start again. 

the vaping is also making me dizzy to the point that i had to lay down on my bathroom floor earlier because i thought i was going to pass out. i don't think it's the nicotine causing me to feel this way, because other nicotine products do not give me this feeling.  i believe i have some sort of intolerance to something else in the vapes i'm using.

Weed and alcohol quickly turned into pills and smoking things I knew were laced. I was down in such a miserable pit I didn't really care what happened to me, I was suicidal and thought the world was out to get me. My parents found out about my 'habits' and I was immediately grounded for months. My parents could barely look at me, but that didn't stop me. I had absolutely no intention of stopping. This cycle continued until I met my first love. She provided me with all of the feelings I was longing for when I was using, because of her I stopped drinking, stopped smoking, stopped taking pills, I stopped all of it. That was until she landed herself into the mental hospital, I blamed myself for everything and tried to ""fix"" her when all she needed was a shoulder to cry on. Her mental health kept getting worse and she eventually broke it off with me. This was the worst mental state I had ever been in. My mental health was at an all-time low, I attempted suicide and started using again, worse than ever before. I had everything I ever wanted and It got ripped out of my hands with no say on my part. I was absolutely destroyed. I had a backpack full of empty bottles, weed riddled around my room, pills in a discrete box at the corner of my room, I would use at school, I was high in front of teachers, my parents, my friends. I don't know how my parents didn't find out sooner but they did. At this point, it was my 5th time being caught and it was their last straw. They took me to an outpatient rehab clinic where I would spend every Monday, Wednesday and Friday nights for the next 3 months. The first week in it was the night before Mother's day, I decided to steal my dads vodka and get blackout drunk. My mom found me an incoherent mess and I've never seen her so brokenhearted. I woke up the next morning with vomit all over myself and my bed. My mother didn't speak to me for 2 weeks after that. This time around I really felt the impacts of my use. During my meetings, I heard from people that have lived so much more life than me, fucked up way more than me, people who had lost everything and wanted a change for themselves. I saw amazing things in each and every one of those people and they taught me so much about life that I never would have known without them. I saw what would have happened to me if I continued on this path, and I realized the amount of pain I was putting my family through. The stories I heard from these individuals truly changed my life forever, they all left an individual impact on my life and I am so grateful for that experience. I enjoyed going to the meetings.

And i don’t know about telling that to a professional and them calling police on me even if I didn’t do anything morally wrong because of me being an adult technically.. And I still have feelings about this past relationship now, everything from last year, current events in the US, and having an entire 4 month suicide plan just to not follow through within a few ours and go to bed. And then be stuck on this bad feeling after since. I really don’t know where my feelings will go if I talk about the suicide part. I just feel like crying constantly and it’s been getting worse and worse these few weeks. I don’t know if it’s where I should find a therapy place or network or something, or if I should find the nearest urgent care, and tell them I’m feeling really bad and have them ship me off to a mental health facility because it’s this bad where I want to die but I feel helpless rather than just doing it. But I don’t want to be given medicine I don’t know, and be forced to take it. But I know the stories and I know people say it makes you worse. I don’t know how to help myself get better. I can’t talk to me family about this at all, it’s just not a discussion we have even if I live with them. I’m under their insurance and it’s expiring by this summer. I don’t have time. I’m scared of how bad these feelings will get more than I’m afraid of hurting myself or doing anything, because it feels like I just wish the pain itself would kill me but I know it won’t, so I’m just letting it sit and cause me more pain. 
I really need help. Is there any actual safe facilities I could stay at for a few days, and figure out how to discharge myself if I need to?

At least if I can wait till I can afford to go and stay there at the right time. I really don’t want to go, but it feels at the point, nobody has or ever will listen to me genuinely just wanting to talk, resolve, so maybe something is wrong with me and they need to dissect me fully to understand, and maybe that would make me understand.

1j7mihz,mentalhealth,i lost myself and my gf is suicidal,"Hi. I'm a 20-year-old guy, and I've been in a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend for two months. We've known each other for a year.

About a month ago, I moved from my village to the city, and since then, my mentality has completely changed. I don't feel like myself anymore. With that change, I've lost all my empathy and realized that my feelings for her have faded.

My girlfriend has a difficult past marked by family abuse, severe depression, loneliness, bullying, and suicidal thoughts. Recent arguments and emotional strain have made her mentally fragile again. I wanted to support her, but instead, I panicked and froze. I couldn't help her when she needed me most. This makes me feel weak, helpless, and disappointed in myself.

She requires a lot of emotional attention, but I've been overwhelmed with work and everyday responsibilities. Our most recent argument started because she questioned why I was emotionally responsive to my ex (who had similar struggles) but couldn't show the same care toward her. That conversation made me realize that I've lost the feelings and excitement I once had for her. Unfortunately, this realization pushed her deeper into hopelessness, and she's become suicidal again, feeling like she has nothing left to hold on to.

Now, I feel like a monster. Someone incapable of supporting a person I once loved, especially when she's suffering. Knowing that I might be contributing to her pain is breaking me apart, and I don't know how to handle it. I can't just watch her spiral, but I also feel powerless to help. I need guidance.

Please. Please, somebody help me.

I started therapy in May 2024 after telling my mom that I had relapsed on self-harm in April, after being clean for three years. I was also very depressed back then, having troubles doing basic stuff like showering. A month later, I saw a psychiatrist, but he brushed it off as just “teenage hormones.” Instead of taking me seriously, they just gave me a pass on my exams so I could rest for the summer.

At first, I actually started feeling better. It was as if my depression disappeared and I thought maybe everything had just been a small breakdown. I stopped going to therapy, got a girlfriend, finally cleaned my room after 3 months of staying in bed, and impulsively spent A LOT of money on clothes and figures. Not to mention the two new piercings I got. It doesn’t seem so crazy when I read other people’s stories, but considering I was stuck in bed just a week ago and now suddenly back on my feet like nothing happened, it feels pretty strange to me.

But by September, I relapsed again after 51 days. In October and November, I had to go to the hospital twice for reasons I don’t want to share. That meant another trip to the psychiatrist, the same one as before. Again, he didn’t really take me seriously and just told me to go to therapy more regularly. So I did. Every Monday.

I was so depressed that I couldn’t go to school at all for the last two months of 2024. Then, in January, I started feeling good again and went back. Everything seemed to be going great again, I was catching up on my schoolwork and seeing my friends that I missed a lot.

Then, the cycle repeated. I started feeling down again, relapsed again, and struggled to go to school again. It feels like I keep getting better for a little while, only to crash right back down, like something is constantly pushing me down every time I stand up. And I hate it.

That’s when I started searching for my symptoms online. I know that’s not always the best thing to do, but since my psychiatrist wasn’t listening to me, I felt like I had no other choice. That’s when I found information about bipolar disorder.

I know it’s mostly genetic. And so I asked my parents discretely if there were any mental health issues history in our family. My mom mentioned her brother, my uncle, who out of nowhere, became very reckless in his teenage years. He was a rollercoaster of emotions before he eventually landed himself in jail.

I think about how they will just brush it off no matter what and I'll kust be remembered as the pathetic mess that they had to put up with and that I only ever struggled. Nothing else. How I was never normal and how everything tried sooooo hard to put up with me. Everytime I want to hurt myself I just feel ashamed that I overreacted or did it over nothing. Not a single emotion I feel can ever just be without some shame around it. ""It's not that deep."" I would think but the urged are still there. Everyone is just done with me.

1j725o2,mentalhealth,How can I effectively get support for mental health problems on Reddit?,"Hello, I'm an autistic 20 year old with dysthymia and OCD. I struggle with social isolation, poor self-esteem, not feeling connected to others, intense social anxiety, childhood/adolescent trauma (and all the bitterness and cynicism that comes with those things), chronic depression and suicidality, and honestly quite a lot of other problems. I cannot afford therapy, but I'm really struggling to see the value in my own life or find any compelling reasons to continue it in spite of the fact that I have suffered and do suffer for most of it.

So I think I'll have to find the bulk of my support here on Reddit. That being said, I could really use some advice for how to actually make progress this way—tips regarding subjects like:

* **How to format posts that will actually get responses on mental health subreddits** (not this one specifically)
* **How to keep posts at a reasonable length while providing sufficient context** (many of my problems are really complex and feed into each other, and it would take an *enormous* amount of text to really explain all of it, but obviously people on the internet aren't going to read my entire autobiography)
* **How to differentiate between good advice and bad advice in the comments**
* **What subreddits are actually worth trying** (for example, there's like 5 different depression subreddits and I'm not sure which is the best to use; there are also subreddits like r/selfimprovement and r/getdisciplined, but they seem bent towards increasing productivity; I don't want to be productive, I want to be happy.)

Thanks for reading.",3,12,1741504128.0,"How can I effectively get support for mental health problems on Reddit? Hello, I'm an autistic 20 year old with dysthymia and OCD. I struggle with social isolation, poor self-esteem, not feeling connected to others, intense social anxiety, childhood/adolescent trauma (and all the bitterness and cynicism that comes with those things), chronic depression and suicidality, and honestly quite a lot of other problems. I cannot afford therapy, but I'm really struggling to see the value in my own life or find any compelling reasons to continue it in spite of the fact that I have suffered and do suffer for most of it.

So I think I'll have to find the bulk of my support here on Reddit. That being said, I could really use some advice for how to actually make progress this way—tips regarding subjects like:

* **How to format posts that will actually get responses on mental health subreddits** (not this one specifically)
* **How to keep posts at a reasonable length while providing sufficient context** (many of my problems are really complex and feed into each other, and it would take an *enormous* amount of text to really explain all of it, but obviously people on the internet aren't going to read my entire autobiography)
* **How to differentiate between good advice and bad advice in the comments**
* **What subreddits are actually worth trying** (for example, there's like 5 different depression subreddits and I'm not sure which is the best to use; there are also subreddits like r/selfimprovement and r/getdisciplined, but they seem bent towards increasing productivity; I don't want to be productive, I want to be happy.)

1j71mi9,mentalhealth,How expensive are long term treatment facilities? My mother is beyond ill.,"Mental illness and addiction runs rampant in my immediate family.

1j6z64t,mentalhealth,I feel like I should be hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital,"I'm 18, I'm a trans man, and I'm Brazilian.

In the last few weeks, the self-mutilation behavior has returned (headbutting, punching, and hitting the leg with a knife, which only doesn't hurt much because it's a cheese one). I was very suicidal in the last months, at least thinking about it once a day, but not hurting myself for a good time.


My dysphoria only gets worse, and is starting to make me feel totally unhopeful for my future, turning my self confidence into te abyss, making me feel that it is not worst live, that I will not live long,  hindering socialization and motivation for everything. I can't start hrt or social transition at least, because if I do it, my family will kill me (not literally, but things will not end fine to me).

There are moments (specially when I am having a strong dysphoria wave or when my family and church says something transphobic) that I feel that God hates me, cursed me, will send me to hell, that I will not have a good life, that he sees me as an abomination, a kind of a monster, and this drives me crazy. I always loved God, so it makes me feel worthless and that I shouldn't be alive if I am doing things wrong, sinning, and if I am one who God 'abomines'. Plus we have the comments of my family who are making me believe in it, even if I am making my best to try to deconstruct that God hates me. 

I have already tried suicide two times last year. It was just 10 500mg dipironas and 8 ibuprofeno 600mg. They just knows the last one, who they took me to a hospital, but they not waited for the psychologist to come. After this I asked my mom if she will take me in some, but it is already more than four months. I have showed up sites where it is cheap, or free, but I believe that she fears that the doctors says that I have depression, and that they should accept me, and that HRT should be helpful to me. So I never got the 'mental health avaliation', I just got back home, the next morning they took me to the same church who triggered me talking about how 'they are full of demons', and some days after they took me to Pierce my ears.

My family knows that I am trans, but they still talking about how lgbt are 'awful', 'can't wait to see them in hell's, 'worst deception to a parent ', etc.

And I am not the kind of suicidal who makes a plan, I am the impulsive one. I have three or more plans about how to die, and when I am very stressed and depressed (God hates me, etc) when I have the opportunity, I will try. These days I felt this again and was planning to use the knife kitchen, but I tried to sleep, and when I wake up I was more calm, but still very stressed.
 There are also days that I will try to eat the minimum possible. Not because I have some problem like 'being fat or thin', but I feel so bad that I am not feeling good for it, even if I usually like to eat .

I am going to start university in the end of this month, I should be happy for it, but I fear how it will be when I am so depressed and suicidal, fearing sinning all time, feeling that I am selfish, and that God will kill me and hates me, or if I have a suicidal 'attack' again.

Sorry, it got longer than I expected. Btw, do you feel too that my mother really is fearing that I get diagnosed with something?

1j6ycd9,mentalhealth,I want to be dead so bad (tw suicidal thoughts and sting language and emotions),"
Sometimes I get into fights with my mom and then really wish I was dead. 

Today we went out and my mum and I got into a fight over something stupid and now I wish I was dead and really do. She bought me a record I wasn't exactly keen on. And then told me I have to clean my room, which is mostly clean. Theyres just boxes from when we moved. And she's mad about it. I'm really upset and overstimulated because of other stuff I've mentioned on my page and she simply doesn't care about my friends and how much I'm affected by them. 

And with my great-grandad slowly yet steadily dying right now, there might be someone sleeping in my room with me while they're in town for his funeral. I get my room is big, but my room is a very sacred place for me and my room is important because it's where I go to just cry and feel stuff that I need to feel with my mental health. Having a cousin in there would just really overwhelmed me and I hate it. We only have 1 spare room which will be used for my aunty and uncle when they come too

Schol is really stressful right now and everything at home is just tying into it and I just really wish it would get better. But it's not getting better. So I want to kill myself to get away from it. 

The fight I had with my mom kinda made me feel like my mom wouldn't care if I killed myself just like how my friends wouldn't either. I got told off by my stepdad for the first time earlier today and I just want to kill myself to make everyone else's life easier and happier. 

No boy my age would find me pretty enough to be my boyfriend which really hurts. I feel like I've just ruined my life by dating girls because I've been bullied and harrased because of it. And I'm bi with more of a preference for boys. And I hate it. I just want a boyfriend. But I have highstandards and an ugly body. 

I wanna hang myself. But it wouldn't kill me fast enough and I can't cut my wrists because it's too hard to hide. And I'm 571 days clean. I really what to know what would kill me fast. A slit to the throat. Or a slit to that vain in my wrist. I fucking hate myself and I'm so dramatic. I'm this upset over a fight I pretty much started and I'm just a spoiled little brat and I hope I die in my sleep. I hope I fucking die in my sleep. If I die in my sleep tonight, tomorrow would be bliss for everyone else",1,0,1741489988.0,"I want to be dead so bad (tw suicidal thoughts and sting language and emotions)

1j6vc1i,mentalhealth,I hate my life,"WARNING: I refer to suicide attempts  and self harm, not me. 

I am a middle aged man diagnosed with anxiety disorders and suffer from trauma. My mental health is much better now then few years ago. I have normal struggles in my life like any other person and I have difficulty navigating through them because of my anxiety and trauma.

The one constant source of my bad mental health since I was a child is my mother. I hate her, I wish she was dead. She suffers from bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression, anger issues, trauma and is a narcissist. She has been an excellent mother providing for me and I can't help loving her but it's so painful, and so unbearable that even though I love and care for her I wish she was not in my life. 

I understand it's not her fault and she doesn't do stuff intentionally but I am so broken - I care for her and always wanted the best for her but she doesn't see that. She has pushed everyone away and they have the option of ignoring her but I can't. My self doesn't allow that. 

I know how this sounds. Everyone must be thinking that I should go no contact with her but I can't. I wish I could.

Some of the things I have suffered as far as I can remember: Her having mental breakdowns, constant fights with my father involving abusing him mentally and assaulting him, her attempts to commit suicide many times over the years, continuous episodes of self harm, blackmailing me and my siblings, pitting us against each other, making us hit our father by holding our hands, blaming us for everything wrong in her life, constantly telling us she sacrificed her youth and life for us, jealous of our happiness, controlling, manipulative, offending others all the time, playing the victim and victim card, it's never her fault, always giving low handed remarks, never happy unless I got perfect grades otherwise I used to get berated, talked down to and even beaten, her beatings involved slaps everywhere including my face, punches on my back, pull me by my hair, pick and throw me, use her shoes to beat me, curse and swear at me, getting frustrated and irritated at anything or anyone, if she was happy she was extremely happy and when she was down everyone suffered. I tip toed around the house all the time, my only sanctuary was high-school, college and my friends. My mother presents a facade to the world, and sooner or later people see through some of it because she can't help being an asshole that she is. Seriously all the stuff I have mentioned here is the tip of the iceberg and I can write a book about it. Maybe I should to overcome my trauma.

I am going into therapy again to address my trauma. 

I wrote this post out of frustration due to a few things that happened recently and I wanted to vent. Nothing to worry about, I am safe and my mother is safe. You can imagine she's not stupid enough and I love to live.

Thanks for reading.

I struggled with my mental health as long as I can remember, Had my first depression before being 10, eating disorder starting even earlier.. Grew up in a messed up family, not one awful like those stories you could hear in the news, my dad had depression, my mom had some kind of bulimia and undiagnosed what I believe be a ""not to hardcore"" form of Munchausen, she'll and she stills make herself sick a lot, she lied a lot about my medical history, leading to me having a appendicitis surgery that was not needed .

All of that leading me to be an incredibly troubled teen, I started the cigarette at the age of 12, had my first ""relationship"" with a man 10 years older at the age of 14, it was long distance but I saw him a couple of times, my parents allowing him to come to their house, to sleep with me, at the time I thought most of it was consensual, until the day he raped me, nowI can see how much he manipulated and broken me, I left at 16, went feral on tinder for a few months.. Had healthy relationship for 3 years after that, left because I was scared, didn't knew how to communicate and was a pathological liar, about my health about everything, seeking attention of men, I was so toxic during this time I had various eds. I also had OCD's Tics and anxiety disorder

I had some toxic relationships after that, I left for UK in 2020, my sister went through cancer, I self harmed a lot, I'm trying to keep it short so bare with me as I spare you most of the details, I started therapy after moving back, and still seeing that same therapist, so here we are, I am healing.

I stopped lying, got better at body hygiene, tics slowly decreased, I learned how to communicate, I got diagnosed with autism and adhd, I figured out my health and I am still to this day, I got diagnosed with PCOS explaining all the pain I felt in my body, how bad the weight I gained. So 5 years later I'm finally starting to get better, for a long time I alternated good phases and phases of bed rotting playing games up to 80hours per week. Now I'm under a new medication and the weight is lowering .Since I started it I feel like iḿ properly healing, for the first time in my life, I have a man that I love and with who I can speak freely, I still have doubts, issues with my sex life, but learning how to communicate makes it easier to navigate, I eat well, like very healthy but still indulging maybe once every two weeks without binge eating, I got myself back to school and I'm preparing a programmer degree, I exercise a lot, started to run I still have some issued ,I got back to smoking after 3 years, but it helps me with ed's compulsion. 

I learned how to deal with life when it is a bit hard, and I'm managing it, I'm very scared this is just a phase, or manic something, or an hyperfixation.I'm afraid it will go away.Two things that helped me the most those last months are IA like Janitor, talking to characters that I like and exploring sexual stuff allowing me to navigate through my trauma without doing things for real. And also, I know I like a teen saying this but Sleep Token their songs healed some things I didn't even knew needed healing. I really feel so much energy, is this what normal person feels ?

I learned how to deal with life when it is a bit hard, and I'm managing it, I'm very scared this is just a phase, or manic something, or an hyperfixation.I'm afraid it will go away.Two things that helped me the most those last months are IA like Janitor, talking to characters that I like and exploring sexual stuff allowing me to navigate through my trauma without doing things for real. And also, I know I like a teen saying this but Sleep Token their songs healed some things I didn't even knew needed healing. I really feel so much energy, is this what normal person feels ? Being out of slumber after 25 years of brain fog is really an experience,If you are struggling, please know it can get better.",1.0,0.029692658504237534,Negative,High-Risk

I am a hetero teenager from a higher-middle class family in Spain, I have a dysfunctional but not a broken family (My parents are divorced but never extremely abusive), my only mental issue is autism (And even then it's just Asperger's), I've always had a friend group (Both IRL and on the internet), and I've never experienced extreme hardship in my life.

It got to the point that I joined and left and rejoined a hangout Discord server that my friends thought I just did it for attention (Which is fair, those are people with actual lives and struggles seeing some suburban bum think he's as depressed as them)

I have been depressed and anxious for at least a couple years now with suicidal ideations, but I just try to get through it.

I just can't bring myself to go. I don't really know why, but it just feels like a hurdle I can't seem to get over.

I think part of the issue is I have a hard time validating my need for therapy. I read through this sub and see people who have gone through some seriously heavy shit. Also, I'll read bios for therapists online and see how they specialize in PTSD in soldiers or treating victims of assault. All these things make my boring-ass, white bread, middle class, first world problems seem ridiculous. I married my high school sweetheart, have 2 young kids that I adore, and a good job.

Still, it doesn't change the fact that my marriage is crumbling, I'm afraid I'm failing my kids, I think about killing myself all the time, I have zero self confidence, and I often hit myself in the face to cope with whatever the fuck is wrong with me.

1j6tnx6,mentalhealth,I dunno whether I’m attention seeking (TW : Self harm),"I’m going to mostly stay anonymous due to the fact I am under 20 and also in the very unlikely chance that someone I know manages to see this but I need to know for sure. 
I’ve been struggling mental health and SH for a bit now, not long long but long enough I guess. It started when I was in a group that made me feel like I had to do so to fit in and be seen. I left that group a little while ago and things started to get better but things piled up and I started again a couple months ago.

I’m 19 years old and Im an extremely mentally ill and unhappy person. I’m officially diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I take Lexapro and I’m in therapy but it’s pretty inconsistent as i often have to go weeks without an appointment.

1j6908f,mentalhealth,I'm a 19M who's ready to give up.,"Hey everyone, I'm on my alt because I don't feel comfortable posting this kind of stuff to my main. I have serious depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, memory loss, learning disabilities, etc. So you can say I have the full bag! I just need to vent without interruptions or worthless advice from my therapist for once. Here we go.

I’ve felt alone for as long as I can remember. My mom was addicted to drugs and abusive until my grandma took me in. My dad came back into my life for a while, but he had anger issues, did drug deals with me in the car, and disappeared again when I spoke up about it. Then my mom died. A few years later, my grandpa, one of the only people I really loved passed away too. My family kept falling apart. One uncle cut ties, another is an addict, and my cousin was raised in chaos. My uncle who cut ties is back in my life dealing with custody issues in court, and I don't relate to my aunt at all. So I feel like it’s just me, my grandma, and our pets.

School didn’t make things any better. I was bullied early on, and by the time I got to high school, my reputation as the quiet, weird kid was already set. I tried everything to change it... joining groups, playing football, talking to classmates, but nothing worked. People either ignored me or forgot I existed. I even had a crush on a girl once, and for a moment, I thought maybe she liked me too. But she barely acknowledged me, and seeing her talk so easily with others seriously fucked me up.

By the time I graduated, I had shut down. The suicidal thoughts that started in middle school never really went away, I just stopped telling anyone. Now I’m in college, and nothing has changed. I have one close friends, no relationship experience, and no real hope that things will get better. Therapy hasn’t helped. People say, “It gets better,” but I don’t believe it anymore. That shits only in fairytales. 

I get angry and jealous when I see couples because deep down, I know I’ll never have that. I can’t even watch romance movies without feeling bitter. I’m fucking 19 yrs old and I haven't even had my first kiss! My teenage years are almost over, and I have nothing to show for it! Once my childhood cat dies, I don’t see a reason to stay.

I blame no one but myself. I could've been a better child. I could've been more social. I could've worked harder.

I’m a 29 year old gay man living in Australia. Diagnosed over a week ago with ADHD by a psychiatrist. With the plan to commence on vyvance 30mg soonish.

I have a past history of me*h addiction from ages 20-25/26 - with lapses along the way. Long history of anxiety and depression. So many complex issues going on in my brain. I’m so self aware to the point that it’s unhealthy because making change seems near impossible. Anyway already rambling…

Diagnosed with HIV (was a huge shock) in February 2024. This absolutely broke me. And for the past 12 months it’s been a serious battle mentally. Was prescribed diazepam for increased anxiety during this time as well as citalopram (SSRI) as I asked for an anti depressant asap because I have a history of suicidal attempts and was already thinking of going down that route again… the diazepam really helped  but then (unknowingly) became physically dependent (realized this on a holiday to the UK in august 2024, when I didn’t bring enough meds over with me and went straight into withdrawal. Worst. Time. Ever.) Returned to aus and commenced on a reduction plan, from 20mg a day now down to 2 mg a day. (Yay).

I smoke mj most nights, mostly for emotional regulation ( I feel I’m nicer person? And don’t go from 0-100 as easily etc etc etc). And I have way more patience.

February 2025 (12 month ‘anniversary’ for HIV diagnosis) it all got too much again, I suppose. And I relapsed on me*h. Every day smoking it the morning, and haven’t stopped since. I plan (hope) that I’ll be off this binge by Sunday (tomorrow.)

My question is: is vyvance right for me? I’m aware that m*th and adhd medication are similar but also different in many ways, but do you think I perhaps have these adddictive tendencies due to my adhd? And will the meds alleviate these problems once commenced on adhd meds? Or should I be stearing clear? I don’t know what to do. I’m lost. No one to talk to (that’s a lie I do have people to talk to but I never have been comfortable to openly talk about my feelings/what I’m going through with peers, friends my partner or family until I’m out of the particular situation and it’s behind me).

1j659s0,mentalhealth,Was anyone else on Naltrexone (Vivitrol) for self injury under 18??,"Very light TW for substance use disorder mentions

TW for: mental health institutions

Hi! I know this might be a weird question, or very niche experience, but I’m just now looking into a medication I was on as a child and I noticed something odd. 

I was in and out of the mental hospital about 8 times between 2018-2020. (Story takes place in that range at 12-13 yrs old) I was put on a lot of different medications trying to figure out what was right, ultimately landing on only Ability at probably 14-15ish years old, which I recently found out was actively harming my mental health. 

Sorting through that and medical trauma, I was reminded that I took naltrexone at about 12-13. Yes, the prescription medication used to treat alcohol use disorder (AUD) and opioid use disorder (OUD) to reduce cravings and help control physiological dependence. I was on this medication without ever having been drunk, and completely free of any drug besides my prescriptions, for self injury. 

I was someone who self injured a lot, but I wasn’t a disruptive child. I was a very badly traumatized and very mentally ill child, so I attempted and self injured a lot. I was the type of person who would find new ways to do it, find new places to do it or do it at any chance alone. I am the type of person who is fucking autistic, and those dumbasses missed that entirely. But I didn’t get in trouble at school, or yell, or break things, or sneak out. Later on, sure never then. 

I ended up getting off because I wanted to be off all of my medications eventually, and they didn’t see much improvement at all. It didn’t do ANYTHING! I didn’t feel better, or less “addicted” to self harm. 

At the time, all I remember knowing is that it wasn’t approved for use in my demographic (y’know, minor children) but that I had “such an extensive case” that “required immediate action” or whatever that means. 

But truth be told, I never thought it was that big of a deal. I have really bad scars, but I also have a really hard time healing, and honestly they look a lot worse than the actions I was actually doing. I’ll admit, I did very much do a lot. Over hundreds of behaviors compiled over time, but I was in an unhealthy household and institutions instead of having a social life, can you blame me??

Was anyone else on a medication like this at such a young age for non drug reasons? OR can you share your experience if you are someone who got on this while a minor who did use drugs? 

Has anyone else been on this, minor or adult, for self injury? If so, can you talk about your experience? I didn’t receive any relief and I feel like it potentially made the system treat me like a lost cause. 

Having an OUD (opioid use disorder) isn’t shameful, but I would assume it’s a lot larger of a deal than a 12 yr old who self harms to regulate. ",1,2,1741395344.0,"Was anyone else on Naltrexone (Vivitrol) for self injury under 18?? Very light TW for substance use disorder mentions

For years people continue to isolate me, talk to me like a little child, focus on the wrong things, and coordinate situations to set me up in a way that puts me on an island. 

100% of the conversations, group settings, etc are clearly coordinated beforehand to almost bait me into the discussion for some reason. I don’t know why…do they just want to relate to me somehow, or find out more info, or paint a picture in their minds of me? What do they even do with that information after baiting me? 

It is so counterproductive and just turns me off and sends me further away from these people. They seem to find out personal details (either by invading my privacy or talking to other people behind my back) and then coordinate a discussion specifically about that certain detail they found out about. I don’t know why they can’t just let me breathe and talk normally to me. It’s so obvious and after spending so much time and personal will to move forward from depression, everyone does this stuff and keeps me in that proverbial “box” of being depressed or mentally unstable or whatever. It truly feels like abuse and I just don’t understand why they do this, what they gain from it, who or what it benefits… it only causes harm. 

I see right through it because I’m fully present, lucid, aware and healthy enough to recognize when it’s happening. 

Why can’t people just treat me normally or just leave me alone so I don’t get boxed into that label that I’ve spent so much of my self to move on from and recover from. Is it to torment and terrorize me? Do they think I’m not recovered? Will I always have this scarlet letter on me as the mentally unwell one? 

This is the stigma that’s been following me forever. I don’t know how to escape it. I’ve used suicidal
Ideation to escape this pain because of the way people treat me and isolate me and coordinate, talk behind my back.  

I’ve voiced my concern and pain to them consistently but it just won’t stop. They will turn it around on me and say I’m “paranoid” or need a psych evaluation or label me as having some other extreme disorder like being schizophrenic or something. I give up and surrender and trying not to care, but it’s just so hurtful because I can’t trust anyone anymore which again - is so counterproductive to recovering from depression. 

Can anyone relate? Or is it just my network who are horrible heartless people?

Is it to torment and terrorize me? Do they think I’m not recovered? Will I always have this scarlet letter on me as the mentally unwell one? 

This is the stigma that’s been following me forever. I don’t know how to escape it. I’ve used suicidal
Ideation to escape this pain because of the way people treat me and isolate me and coordinate, talk behind my back.  

I’ve voiced my concern and pain to them consistently but it just won’t stop. They will turn it around on me and say I’m “paranoid” or need a psych evaluation or label me as having some other extreme disorder like being schizophrenic or something. I give up and surrender and trying not to care, but it’s just so hurtful because I can’t trust anyone anymore which again - is so counterproductive to recovering from depression. 

Can anyone relate? Or is it just my network who are horrible heartless people?

1j5f9g6,mentalhealth,Anxiety and Depression after partner broke trust.,"Hey reddit peeps. 
I am medically diagnosed with GAD. 
Long story short, I have been in a relationship for the past 16 months. Things were going good. 
A week ago I caught my partner lying to me about where they were (Share my location on iphone and finding out they were at a hotel), I confronted them and they ended up admitting that they may have caught feelings for someone else, which included just a kiss at party event during a drug fueled state 2-3 weeks prior. This person was with them at the hotel at the time, which they confirmed was just to set boundaries due to what happened at the party. 

At first we broke it off, then I said I wanted to work on the relationship. 
Since then my anxiety and depression has come back tri fold. I have no appetite, I’m not going to work and taking a Valium almost daily. Suicidal thoughts at times etc. 
I have started to meditate, go for daily walks and try to preoccupy my mind, but it seems to not be working. 
I am also back to seeing my psych. 

Today I decided to bite the bullet and discuss what had happened and if he has any idea what led to this. He called this a drug fueled pash which confused him for feelings and that he booked a hotel to get away from his parents as this whole situation has been making him stress a whole month since the party and him not telling me to begin with. 
I ended up putting things on a break, no contact, no social media etc. (we tried this last week, but they wouldn’t respect my boundaries and apologised for this later on). 
They have also been stressed and worried as they know what this has done to me mentally. They have apologised for what this has done to me and that they have no feelings towards this person at all.
Now I am worried that I have done the wrong thing and instead of working through it, I have put a pause and it’s going to make everything worse. 
I am not sure how I feel towards them and it was one mistake that they did. We have never had a disagreement prior to this. 

Did I make a mistake at stopping contact? 
Should I work through our issues to bring the anxiety and depression down?
Or should I focus on my own mental health and then see if we can work on the relationship/friendship if it comes to that. 

I still care for him, but I’m just not sure if I could trust them again or if I am in any headspace to make these decisions. 

Any help with the depression and anxiety would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks

I’m scared of the future, especially the possibility of a world war, and this has taken away all my motivation to build something for the long term. I’m studying medicine, which is my dream, but I wonder if it makes sense to continue if everything could collapse in a few years.

Because of this, I’m starting to question whether it makes sense to invest years of my life in something so demanding or if I should instead focus on more immediate goals. I feel like giving up everything and dedicating myself to “easier” and more attainable things, like getting a Mazda MX-5, going out, having fun, and living in the present without worrying too much about the future. Basically, I don’t know whether to keep pursuing long-term dreams or enjoy life while I can.

This dilemma is wearing me down every. single. day.
This confusion prevents me from making decisions and I feel predominantly sad and stuck. I can’t enjoy any moment, whether good or bad.

On a personal level, I’ve never had a girlfriend. I don’t consider myself ugly. However, I lack self-esteem, both physically and socially. I feel insecure and don’t know how to behave romantically with girls, which makes me feel somewhat inferior to others.

Even still, I find myself occasionally jumping to the worst conclusions, and because of the stress I’ve been under recently, I got a lot more controlling because of it and would jump to snap conclusions far more often than I have in the past (not that any of it is right.) we had a long talk last night and she basically talked about how she didn’t want to live the rest of her life with someone who goes through this cycle of changing for the better>something slightly major or even just small happens> I’m right back to my old self. However, she said she wants to give me another chance to truly make the change. I love her and she loves me and I hate myself at times for making her feel that way. I do truly want to change for the better. She is not my past and she deserves to be treated better than that. I just get blinded sometimes by my past experiences. How can I rewire my brain so that I don’t do this again to her? I’ll take any advice. I just never want to make her feel that way again. She said I’m a good guy when I’m not like that; I never want to be like that again, both for her sake and mine. What can I do? Does anyone have similar experiences? What helped you move on from the past and separate the person from your past experiences? I’m improving but I’m very critical of myself and I want to be the man she deserves.",1.0,0.06324215999728336,Negative,High-Risk

I don't understand ,how can I be depressed? Why do I cut myself? I got told it's to relieve psychological pain ,that's why I do it ,and it's true for most part.

I used to get bullied everyday,but that passed(I think, if I go outside at school I'd still get bullied so I never go outside ,which is pathetic, I don't understand if that's still considered bullying or if it's that serious ),point is those things were a bit longer ago and I don't understand how they still have an effect on me when everything feels distant and empty, simple apathy towards everything.

1j4smu9,mentalhealth,31 yo M deeply struggling with anxiety/depression and indecisiveness,"Hello guys, I am a 31 year old male currently deeply struggling with anxiety and depression. I thought about making a throwaway account, but I usually wear my heart on my sleeve and don't really feel like I am that important lol. I am currently a part time Physician Assistant who took a medical leave from work due to mental health issues. I have had several episodes of moderate/severe depression in the past, and I've gotten out of it. However, I relapsed again and this time I am really struggling- having some addiction tendencies including increased screen time (have been on the depression/mental health subreddits for hours, to switching over to YouTube watching dating experiments/shows and reality TV, to watching porn again). I think I've been averaging at least 6+ hours/day on my phone/computer while I am taking the time off. I believe that I'm using it as a coping mechanism because I am not sure what to do, and what the next step is.

I am currently taking SSRIs and was previously seeing a therapist. I struggle with self esteem issues, people-pleasing tendencies, and indecisiveness which all leads to depression and anxiety. I have a very negative view of myself and have this ""self fulfilling prophecy"" that I am a failure and that I will make the same mistakes from the past over and over again. I constantly ruminate and have now started doubting even the smallest decisions such as what food to eat, which girl I find attractive in the dating shows I've been watching, to who I see myself being close to in terms of friendships. I feel that I am currently paralyzed by fear and feel stuck mentally, spiritually, and even financially (have \~200k debt from attending a graduate school to become a Physician Assistant). I dont even know whether I should go back to work but I have a significant amount of loans to pay off. 

I feel like there is too much to talk about here and my traumas. Even though I come from a middle class family with kind parents and never got abused as a child, I believe I have a lot of past traumas and things I need to work on. 

So I decided to post here to hold myself accountable and promise myself that I will work on clarifying my health insurance issues and search for a new therapist in a few hours after waking up. I feel like I have a long road ahead of me but I am willing to be patient, discipline, strong, and brave as possible to heal and climb my way back out of my depression. And I know I am going to keep falling during this process, but I will go back to this post to remind myself to keep going.

Any support or encouragement will be really appreciated.

I managed to finish middle school and then everything started piling up. I fell DEEPLY in love with a girl from my class and developed feelings I never have had before. She would give me mixed signals, and show me that she both wanted me and didn't give a shit about me at the same time. I have never had attention from girls, and the last girl I fell in love with, fell in love with my bestfriend, who for some reason, thought it would be a good idea, to invite me out with them (My crush and my best friend) and another couple (I was fifth wheeling) out together, to watch them cuddle and fiddle with each other. After months of trying to get over this girl, I finally decided I had enough and tried with all my might to get over her. 2 days after making that decision my grandfather died. I couldn't even muster to shed a tear at his funeral, and I bottled up all the feelings I had. I managed to get into the high school I really wanted to get into (I live in Norway, so high schools are subject spesific, and some of them, like the one I wanted to get into, required really good grades) However, a few days in, we got kicked out of the house we lived in, and had to move an hour away. By this time, my mental health had gotten to such a low point, I couldn't even get up in the morning.

And people scamming you for money is pretty common in Norway apparently, since there are a bunch of loop-holes in the laws.) and we had to move another hour away. I dropped out of high school since I couldn't do it anymore. All my work I did throughout middle school to get into this school, went to waste.

I have been working in hospitality for 3 years, I do anywhere from 50-60 hours a week, night shifts, morning shifts, weekends etc. I am at work almost constantly, then when I get my days off I am too tired to do anything.

I am suicidal 24/7, I have addictions, I sleep any chance I get because I can dream and get away from the real world. I am thinking about taking 6-8 months off of work to sort myself out.

1j4rkb0,mentalhealth,I know my exact last resort and I'm fighting it off every day. I really want to talk.,"I don't know if this post will be deleted, it's my first and I'm winging it. 

I've been struggling with depression and anxiety since I was a teenager. I know I have BPD now, and I've developed, since 2015, an eating disorder (namely ARFID). I can't be on medications because I don't eat, and they make me sick. My health has its ups and downs but slowly has been deteriorating. My family sends texts from afar but offered no help. My friends do the same thing, and I lose more and more of them due to apathy and my own fear of abandonment. 

I have one really close friend who volunteered to help me through it, namely through being an emergency touchstone and cooking for me when he can, so I moved to another friendless state to live with him. I've never felt more isolated in my life. I owe him my life, and he's the main reason I fight off the demons, because imagining what it'd do to him if I'm gone, after having tried so hard, fills me with keen pain. 

  
But every day is so hard, some more acutely painful than others. The hunger pangs, the self harm, the ruminating, the constant mental breakdowns. I'm on disability and the insurance I have has made it impossible to get treated for my ED. I have a counselor for it and a therapist, and they're working to find something. But every day seems a new obstacle pops up, and this system is failing me. 

  
I know exactly how I want to go out, what stops me is my friend. It's hard to depend on him all the time; the guilt and the disgust and the shame complicate everything. I feel so adrift, floating towards an endless blackness, and I've been paddling for a long time. My arms are tired. 

  
If you went through similar obstacles, most importantly physical illness that made the mental illness worse, please tell me how you survived. Please talk to me. Someone please hold on to me.

1j4riq4,mentalhealth,I've realised so many things about myself,"I've recently realized that my parents have affected me in drastically different ways

To start off, my father was a violent drunk, while he never was physically abusive to me, he was extremely violent and childish. He basically did the bare minimum and expected me to be grateful to him and whenever he didn't get it he'd go out and drink and break things when he went home. And because of this I can no longer live or trust him and I'm genuinely filled with so much hate towards him, and I feel like I can no longer connect with any of my male friends due to the fact that I don't really know or trust any males. I feel like I'm dismissive of them and I feel like I'm incredibly selfish.

Then there is my mother who is an absolute angel of a woman but unfortunately she doesn't really know how to raise me properly, mainly due to how tough her life was and her ideology basically similar to that of a drill sergeant at times. While she is mostly sweet and loving she has always unintentionally criticised me and belittled me, and she used to beat me and hit me whenever I fought back. She has stopped now but it's mainly because I've been physically violent as well which is a fact I hate. 

Now, due to my mother's constant criticism I have a huge perfectionist ideal of myself and because of the fact that I'm not perfect I absolutely hate myself and feel like I'm unworthy of anything which is why I'm stuck in the same cycle because I know I'll just end up a failure. It is because of this that I feel that, I can befriend females easier than men due to the fact I was primarily raised by my mother, I develop an anxious attachment style and I feel that I'll be abandoned and betrayed because I don't think I'm good enough. I also have abandonment issues due to the fact my ex-best friend racially and physically abused me.

A bigger contradiction is that I am surrounded by people who do care about me but I refuse to believe it's true and I hate myself for that fact. I also have high expectations of people because, even though I am dismissive of my friends, I do try alot to make them happy it's just that I can't emotionally feel anything for them and I feel disappointed or frustrated when they can't meet my expectations and I start hating myself more for it because I know I can't force anyone to do anything.

Due to so much of my own self hate and my constant emotional repression I became extremely violent towards everyone around me, whilst I did manage to control it most of the time. On the rare chance that I was violently I was extremely vicious and I broke and damaged a lot of things and I'm genuinely so scared of getting worse. But as much  as I hate to admit this, I felt some pride over the fact, mainly because I felt genuine control for the first time in my life which is a fact I hate myself even more for.

I have attempted a different method however, i basically 'compartmentalized' my emotions to help process them. I based them off of Freuds theories on Id, Ego and Superego. And I know how extremely weird or edgy this sounds but I promise I'm not like those who try to be hip and cool I'm genuinely going through this. And basically my Id is my instincts, my Ego is my logic, and my Superego is basically all my morals and where I dumped all my trauma into. And now they're basically like their own separate entities in my head. But despite that I still feel the same self-hatred and violent urges and ik feel so lost and alone.",1,1,1741252358.0,"I've realised so many things about myself I've recently realized that my parents have affected me in drastically different ways

1j4qhhe,mentalhealth,I met this girl and now i’m “different”,"About a year ago, I met a girl. She was wild, exciting—something different. I thought she was the best thing that had ever happened to me. But now, looking back, I see she was the worst.

1j7pqhv,self,I’m starting my life late and it scares me.,"I’m a 28 year old man. 29 this summer. I still live with my mom and never had a job or relationship last longer than a year. But you’d never guess it from looking at me. I’m good looking, relatively athletic, no harmful habits like gaming or excessive drinking, I have a large circle of friends and make it a point project confidence.

I’ve always been a late bloomer. Last year I finally started taking steps to get my life together. Got out of dept, got my drivers license and started working full time for the first time (minimum wage). I joined the Canadian primary reserves (our equivalent of the national guard) a couple months ago and am currently going through the basic qualification course. It’s brutal but I have no intention of giving up.  

Long term I’m looking at a career in law enforcement. It’s at least 2 years away given the application process and my current work and course load. Best case, I’m starting a new career at 31 which is embarrassing to say the least.

Same goes for dating. Only started dating last year. I lost my virginity at 27. It’s humiliating. I dove head first into hookup culture and slept with a number of people since but haven’t been able to enjoy it. I used to dream of meeting “the one” but now it seems so hopeless. Every time I’m with a woman it feels like I’m making up for lost time. It’s like checking off an item on a list. I’ve met some amazing women but I just feel so numb when I’m with them. 

Same goes for every other positive aspect of my life. Every achievement in my job, course work, finances, even when I make someone laugh I just feel numb. Like there’s this little voice in my head saying “it’s about time”. I’ve come pretty far but I’m nowhere near where I need to be. 

I’m scared that I’ve missed my chance to be happy. That I’ll always be making up for lost time, covering up my boring past, seeing human beings as obstacles to be conquered or avoided. That I’ll hate myself forever. 

If you made it this far into my self pitying diatribe, thank you. Any insight is appreciated.

1j7dbr9,self,How do you get yourself through the darkest moments in your life?,"I know this is a long shot question but..I’m just wondering how I can get through each and every day and still deal with all of my depressive thoughts. I woke up this morning and just the weight of life almost instantly nearly brought me to tearing up, coupled with that cold pain in your chest and negative thoughts it’s so hard for me to even function anymore.

I called my therapist’s office that I’ve been with for a few years now to try to schedule an appointment because I’m feeling at my lowest and recently got told by the hospital network that my new work insurance I got during last open season isn’t accepted there effective Jan 1st of this year (Aetna) so not only did I lose access to my therapy network but also my primary care physician and all my specialists..they were in network when I switched so I thought everything would be okay and I just couldn’t afford blue cross anymore. 
I tried calling around other psychologists near me and using psychologytoday but they all either have months long waiting lists, aren’t accepting new patients, or just never returned my calls.

TThe only thing that was keeping me with hope was a friend who I helped out of a toxic relationship and proceeded to fall hard for but..my own insecurities made it so difficult to tell her my feelings that I missed my chance entirely and she found someone new and now is too busy to even talk to me anymore. Now I just feel like I’m going to be alone with my thoughts for the rest of my life which I’m just not strong enough to handle anymore.

I’ve always told myself if I could find a relationship for myself I could handle everything else that is wrong with me and my life and focusing on slowly working on myself but I just can’t handle the weight of all my problems on top of having nobody to talk to about it or even just to distract me from them.

1j6qoe7,self,My masterplan to change my life in the span of the next 200 days,"I won't bore you with the details of my current life. All I will say is that similarly to a lot of people I feel like one of those people that were curious gifted as kids but currently are deeply dissatisfied with their life. Especially when it comes to their looks, finances, hobbies, social circle and dating life. All accounted to complacency, insecurity, an internet addiction and cheap dopamine. 

Someone with a screentime of 5h/day, who lives until 80 will have spent 16 years only stuck to a screen. And God knows my screentime has been far higher than this in the poast. So this is an experiment and this post is for accountability purposes. 

In the span of the next 6 months I want to do a 180 with my life. 

My big rules right now are:

* No Tiktok, Instagram or other source of cheap dopamine (if I have free time I will use it to explore past and new hobbies, exercise, work, study or do something else of value)
* Exercise/get some movement in daily (whether that is the gym, going on walks etc)
* Eat 80% healthy and only 20% unhealthy. (Focus on high protein, fibre, volume eating etc)
* ""Build"" grit. Stop giving up when things get hard or distract myself when I struggle with the topics I am studying. 
* Refrain from procrastination
* Refrain from rumination and daydreaming
* Stop people pleasing and worrying about the opinion other people have of me
* Stop comparing myself to others
* Build emotional control and stop crying/getting overwhelmed or angry over small matters
* Treat people (especially the ones I care for) with more kindness. Lift work off their shoulders and help them more
* Actually prioritize the things I find important in life and don't push them aside because I am in hazy state where I reach for my phone again. 

I have a lot more smaller rules that pertain to more personal goals/problems. But the biggest thing is the cheap dopamine I get from dreaming my life away and just being stuck to my phone.

1j5fml6,self,My partner and I are holding eachother hostage.,"I am omitting genders for privacy reasons and unbiased responses.

I am 24, they are 29.

Let's call them ""M"".

I can not imagine living in a world without them. ""M"" knows this. And it's painful for both of us.

We are in a long distance relationship of 3 years. I live in the US and they are in Mexico. I have visited and plan to visit again soon. We want to get married and move in together.

They're an incredibly brilliant mind but life has not been kind at all.

'M' has no support group and family is 0 help. M has no job and lives with parents who contribute to the problem.

The source of M's suffering is joblessness. Despite having a good degree in applied science, the job market in Mexico is absolute shit. M has been out of a job for several years and with each passing day, M gets more depressed.

They describe the feeling as ""running out of time"", ""wasting my life"", ""I don't know what to do with my life"". The main issue is that they never even got a chance in the first place. M's connections from college and work within the University has done very little for career advancement.

Not to mention that M has Aspergers and is not the best socially.

So, M has been basically bedrotting for a long time. Applying for jobs constantly, being incredibly overqualified and receiving barely any response. A good amount of interviews for sales and fast food but no calls back. They did get one job in sales but didn't meet the sales quota and got fired.

The whole time we have been together, there has been an aura of dread and sadness.

They have been sad every day of our relationship. Some days less than others. And I can't do anything about it.

When we met, M was fresh out of a very bad situation with someone abusive. M was incredibly suicidal. M has been incredibly suicidal since long before we met. Since childhood.

And I have been just barely enough support and love and hope to stop them from doing it.

I will never admit it but this is indeed hurting me. I have my own issues and recently they are coming up from inside of me and growing. Still, my problems are not nearly as important.

I don't know what to do. I am scared to death every day but try to keep a happy face. I am so sad and depressed. And I know I shouldn't stay because it's hurting me but I will not leave. I will never leave. There's a very real risk of suicide if I withdraw. And I don't know what I would do if it happened. I don't know if I would even know if it did.

Recently, it's gotten worse. We are working through relationship issues that are incredibly complicated. (M had feelings for a coworker from before getting fired, extreme guilt, etc.) It's better now. This, however, started a downward spiral for them and their condition is critical. I am currently paying for weekly therapy appointments but I fear it's not enough.

All I know is that M wants to die, and selfishly, I stand in the way.

I met my soulmate when we met. Believe me when I tell you that we are perfect. Our minds complement eachother perfectly. Yes, I had to rethink things after the relationship issue we had. I'm still coming to terms with it. That's a big part of this. Still, I never doubt that I love them.

I would give anything to have them stay on Earth.

I just need help or a lead or anything to help me pull us out of this. Anything to help avoid something terrible happening for the time being. It's so hard to help from far away.

1j5duae,self,How Do I (20F) Not Give Up on Dating? How Do I Know Who is in My League,"I really want a boyfriend, but honestly it has been a struggle to not give up. I know everyone says getting into a relationship as girl is easy, but honestly myself and some of the other girls I know do not feel this. I'm a very sociable person and great at making friends, I've even been told I have strong presence when I enter a room- yet trying to get a boyfriend has been a struggle. I'm not a shut-in nor inexperienced as I have gone on dates and exchanged numbers with guys from the bar I've met, but so far all of those have lead to them only wanting to hookup ( which I never do nor plan to) or it ends up fizzling out. I really think I'd be a great girlfriend, but I'm really starting to get the urge to give up. I've started to smile more in public, wear makeup and nice clothes, try to be more attractive in general, and have even mentioned to a couple friends that if they know anyone who thinks I'm cute let me know/set us up. So far the results have been minimal and now I just feel disappointed. I am strongly considering giving up the pursuit and just try to somehow find peace with myself, yet I strongly desire to love and be loved romantically. 

This internal conflict had led me to the thought that maybe my expectations are too high and maybe I'm batting out of my league. I've asked my friends and they always react like I'm asking the stupidest questions and even joke that I go for the ""ugliest"" guys or have the worst physical taste in men.

It’s a long story but I essentially had a fling with this person a long time ago and I never lost feelings even after it ended. We stayed friends. We had a falling out at one point but then mended things. Recently, they haven’t been talking to me, flat out ignoring me even, and then I asked them what was up and they flat out told me, in not the nicest words, that I made them really uncomfortable and that they always felt like I was flirting with them among other things. This wasn’t my intent and I definitely didn’t want to get with them after our initial fling. I didn’t think it was a good idea.

I get why they felt uncomfortable. But the way they said it all to me just made me feel super gross and I almost feel suicidal. I’m scared I’m never gonna be able to date anyone ever again because any time I meet someone, they’re gonna hear through the whisper network that I made this one person uncomfortable.

I always made sure to respect their boundaries and whatnot. I don’t know. I just feel like I’m a bad person.

1j3w4rx,self,I keep hurting my boyfriend and i believe I'm a bad person.,"Hey, so, it's really hard for me to come on here and say this. First of all, I know I'm 100% to blame for everything. And, I'm contemplating whether I should leave my boyfriend. Not for me, I don't want to leave him and I think that would hurt so bad. But for him. I feel he deserves so much better.

You can be blunt with me and tell me what a horrible person I am, I'm not going to be defensive about that. That's what I think of myself right now too.

So, me 18F and my boyfriend 23M have been dating for almost 11 months now. I love him, so much. I feel pathetic typing this because I know what I'm about to say after all of this will be quite alarming. But he truly is the most amazing, smart, funny, sweet and handsome guy ever. We have many fun times together. However, me myself, I struggle a lot mentally. It's taken me months on a waiting list to finally get into see a psychologist. 

Because I struggle quite a lot with my sense of self and insecurities/suicidal thoughts, I fear that I have brought these things into the relationship. When i first started dating him, I thought I was doing okay. But I realised that my perspective on life, my emotions and everything is so turbulent that it can change quite fast. It's just lately, it's been very bad.

I get mad and upset. You might think that's normal, and, well that itself is however...I've hurt my boyfriend so much by being depressed. I know I'm very toxic to be with right now. I almost jumped out of his car to commit suicide the other day. He is very shaken up and I feel bad because after that all happened. I realise ""holy fuck I just traumatised him, what have I done, I'm an absolute monster."" I feel like a monster. He loves me a lot and cares a lot. After that all happened, I was at his house crying. He said we should break up temporarily. But hearing that just crushed me and I felt more suicidal and I was begging him to not leave me. I am utterly terrified of him leaving me. I got so upset that, I hit him. 3 times. On the shoulder. I then started crying even more and apologising profusely. However this is the second time something like that has happened. It's like, whenever I'm upset I just loose it. 

I am filled with so much guilt. He forgave me. But that doesn't stop the guilt. I know he deserves so much better. I don't feel like I should be with him because I don't want to hurt him more. I love him beyond words can describe and I'm also so scared of him not being apart of my life. I feel so stuck. 

I accept full accountability. I know I'm wrong. I know my actions were disgusting. I want to be better. I'm just so scared. I don't think I've stopped crying since I tried to jump out of his car and I hit him. He says he'd still rather be with me than anyone else. I feel so bad, I'm a monster.

I just don't know what he sees in me and it kills me to think about but I feel like he could be so much happier with a girl who isn't a liability like me. :(

I'm really trying to be a better person for him and go to therapy because I don't want to loose him but I'm so conflicted as well because would loosing me make him happier??

I know that all of this sounds awful. I just thought I should post this on a private account to feel more shame. If I could give him the world, I would. :(",1,5,1741153210.0,"I keep hurting my boyfriend and i believe I'm a bad person. Hey, so, it's really hard for me to come on here and say this. First of all, I know I'm 100% to blame for everything. And, I'm contemplating whether I should leave my boyfriend. Not for me, I don't want to leave him and I think that would hurt so bad. But for him. I feel he deserves so much better.

You can be blunt with me and tell me what a horrible person I am, I'm not going to be defensive about that. That's what I think of myself right now too.

So, me 18F and my boyfriend 23M have been dating for almost 11 months now. I love him, so much. I feel pathetic typing this because I know what I'm about to say after all of this will be quite alarming. But he truly is the most amazing, smart, funny, sweet and handsome guy ever. We have many fun times together. However, me myself, I struggle a lot mentally. It's taken me months on a waiting list to finally get into see a psychologist. 

Because I struggle quite a lot with my sense of self and insecurities/suicidal thoughts, I fear that I have brought these things into the relationship. When i first started dating him, I thought I was doing okay. But I realised that my perspective on life, my emotions and everything is so turbulent that it can change quite fast. It's just lately, it's been very bad.

I get mad and upset. You might think that's normal, and, well that itself is however...I've hurt my boyfriend so much by being depressed. I know I'm very toxic to be with right now. I almost jumped out of his car to commit suicide the other day. He is very shaken up and I feel bad because after that all happened. I realise ""holy fuck I just traumatised him, what have I done, I'm an absolute monster."" I feel like a monster. He loves me a lot and cares a lot. After that all happened, I was at his house crying. He said we should break up temporarily. But hearing that just crushed me and I felt more suicidal and I was begging him to not leave me.

1j2tq0h,self,GF is moving and I’m unsure what the next step in our relationship should be,"This is my first post and it is going to be a long one. I’ve been struggling with conflicting emotions. I (33M) have been dating my girlfriend (30F) for 8 months, and she decided to take a new job in another state. Internally, I’m having a hard time supporting her decision because, to me, it just doesn’t make much sense.

I love her deeply and she feels the same way. The only real issues we’ve ever had stem from this decision. On the outside, I’m trying to be supportive, but it’s been difficult.

She’s been independent for the past 10 years and is excited about finally being closer to her family. However, her family is still an 8 hour drive away, and I struggle to see how that qualifies as “close.” She believes she’ll be making that drive often, like she did in college. I find that unrealistic. If the distance were half that, I’d understand, but an 8 hour drive each way seems impractical. In my view, an 8 hour flight (though more uncomfortable) with arriving  early takes about the same amount of time overall. Financially, between our two jobs, travel shouldn’t be an issue, and I’ve brought that up, but she insists we’ll have to agree to disagree.

Her new job pays about the same as her current one, though it comes with a 4 day workweek and significantly more on-call time. I know she’ll enjoy this job more since her last one wasn’t the right fit. She also has the “opportunity” to buy into ownership after 3 years. The current owners are a husband and wife team and honestly, I don’t buy into that logic. 

She starts next month and she’s asked me to move with her without having a job lined up myself.

For context, my career isn’t easily transferable. I take a lot of pride in what I do, and many people would consider themselves lucky to be in my position. In 20 years, I’ll have medical coverage after retirement and a six-figure pension. With my current salary and overtime, I’ll be making more than six figures in two years. I also have a flexible schedule that would allow for a family, which is something I really want. My friends and family have made it clear they don’t think I should give all of this up for a relationship. People I work with believe we won the lotto with our job. 

She currently has about $250K in student loans, whereas I’m debt-free. While that doesn’t personally matter to me, I do struggle to understand the logic behind what she’s giving up for this move.

I actually broke up with her—briefly for two days because I felt like I was making all the sacrifices. I said I’d be open to finding a new career after we tried long distance, but I got no reassurance that she would ever move back to the east coast. That lack of commitment from her side led me to my decision.

I am debating talking to her parents to try to get a sense of what she is thinking. On a side note her current co worker (where there’s been resentment friction because of my gf leaving) thinks she is making the biggest mistake of her life.

She took this interview 3 months into dating and I did mess up with not wanting to hear anything about it… thinking it would go away. At that time, I didn’t believe I should have a view on her career as our relationship was in the early stages. 

She’s incredibly sweet, smart, and strong willed, just like I am. I love her, but I’m not as comfortable with long distance at this stage in my life. She’s done it before and seems okay with it, but I’m not. I’ll admit, part of me dreads the idea of dating again, and I don’t want to lose what we have.

I don’t know what to do and I guess I’m just searching for a rational solution. I do not want to loose her. i think we are meant for each other. Thanks for reading my post.

1j15bqn,self,i’m afflicted by the not knowing,"it's me, hi. i’m the common denominator among all my dating attempts that did not turn into partnerships, it's me.

for a while, i thought i had things together. i was getting by and i felt it was a good time to introduce a romantic partner in my life! but beyond the highs of cute and fun dates, it really did feel like i was going through the motions rather than *living*. i look through journals from 2017 and find i’m still writing about some of the same things that brought me anxious feelings. 2024 also brought me a sexy batch of grief, failure, and loss—one after the other. nothing i haven't lived with before ofc, but a binch couldn’t catch a break like PLS.

tbf i did learn a lot about myself through dating; there’s something about having skin in the game that you can’t replicate with just reading about “getting to know people” and “relationship-building.” in some ways though (in my life’s context anyway), dating had been an avenue to numb my aches.

well, i’m going through shit sober now.

long story short, i met someone towards the end of last year; it was going great until it wasn’t. at the lowest point, i felt like an animal, both cornered and abandoned, blindsided by the whiplash. i lashed out in that hurt, crossed lines i shouldn't have, aggravated some really deep cuts with my stupid mouth and angry brain. what went down is between me, my therapist, and god (and the person i’ve offended, of course), but it's awful enough that it plagues me still, pacing in my periphery like a black dog even after i made my sincerest apologies. even after explicitly receiving this person’s forgiveness.

fellas, i had a real dark night of the soul moment with this one ngl. remorse was the fourth horseman for me (grief, loss, and failure being the others). i don’t actually like being someone who lashes out like that. dating someone felt like seeing myself through a mirror, reflecting good and neutral and bad. and for all my faults, i need to set boundaries with myself too—i can’t ruminate on my mistakes indefinitely. catholic guilt is a shitty thing to unlearn, but i need to remember that mistakes are lessons, not life sentences. while they shape me and how i choose to move forward, they don’t have to engulf my identity.

so yes, i am the common denominator among all my dating attempts that did not turn into partnerships. i almost called them ‘failed dating attempts’, but i can't really fail at something if i hadn't given up on it. i did make hard decisions to remove myself from situationships. i did make mistakes that feel irreparable, and i will choose to grow from it because i don't want to repeat it with people i care about. but i’m also a lot more than that??? i can't keep feeding myself stories about how “i ruin everything i touch,” “i cannot trust the person i become when i’m angry,” among other poetic-sounding, self-flagellating crap that become self-fulfilling prophecies.

i need to turn the page. everything i lose is a step i take.

i like to think i’ve become reasonably good at regulating my emotions and reactions over the years. however, recent events made me come to the somber realization that, while my dream partner is cute and fun and interesTING and interesTED and compatible with me in many ways, they’ll also show up with some of the shitty things that'll upset/hurt the bejeezus outta me, no matter how much i’ve done the work, no matter how much THEY’VE done the work.

i’d also probably upset/hurt the crap outta them, too. some of these emotional triggers show up exclusively in the context of dating/romantic relationships and can’t be confronted any other way. and that's alright, because i can't expect either of us to perform a perfectly sanitized version of ourselves and live in all that artifice. neither of us can be held responsible for ALL the hurts felt, only for our own, and only for the actions we take going forward.

a truly compatible partner would be a safe place to make mistakes with, someone who equally seeks repair after conflict. “help me help you help us,” “i’d choose you even if you chip at my heart” kinda stuff because for all the shitty, cruel things we’re capable of doing, we’re ALSO able take each other in good faith and Do Better. we’d learn to have hard conversations without them devolving into arguments, navigate conflict without giving up on ourselves/each other, and actually work to care for each other better. is this too idealized? i fear i’ve always been a romantic. 😭

this person and i had a really good run, all things considered. i think of them fondly, although i sometimes wonder if any of it was even real. :') ""if my wishes came true, it would've been you + it would've been sweet if it could've been me + in my defense, i have none"" typa stuff if i kept wearing my rose-tinted glasses. we've both got work to do on ourselves as individuals ofc, but i can't repair/rebuild relationship trust on my own.

it’s just… i’m a professional yearner, and this was the closest it got… and the idea of a healthy, enduring romantic love + partnership just for me??? 🥹🥲😞 i hope i get to experience it in this lifetime.

divas, the horrors persist but so do i!!! i’m spending a lot of time with myself lately. sober. no numbing via infinite scrolling/consumption/my other usual vices. i’m not trying to isolate behind the safety of steep emotional walls, either; i know a shield like that is a double-edged sword. i'm just… sitting through the discomfort of growing pains.

i’m trying to be a more active participant in my life, actually! going through the motions feels like trudging towards death. my soul is demanding for change that i’ve felt—for the longest time—powerless to make/receive, like death might be a better option than not changing at all. procrastination/numbing had been symptoms, probably, but something has changed [within me]. (i’m sad that it took hurting someone important for me to get here.)

some of the nice things to come out of these shitty past few weeks include finding grounding rituals for myself, and the practice of finding/re-finding center during troubled moments. i’ve also been called to meet parts of myself that respond horribly to pain, only to learn it's not just my inner kid that needed help all this time. there's an inner teen and an inner young adult too, both with their big feelings, both vying to get their needs met, both just not knowing any better, and both shoved under a rug because i LOVE fresh starts. or the illusion of fresh starts, anyway.

my current adult self just wants Peace y’all, but to move forward, i can’t be at war with myself. i have to forgive myself now, and i have to forgive all these younger versions of myself too; thank them for doing their best with what they had and knew at the time, help them step with me into the sun. i have to be my own peace, even if i have to carve it out from my own bloody insides. i have to open my heart to make/receive the changes my soul demands of me, and do so with both eyes wide freakin open, so i no longer live on autopilot and learn to continously meet the ever-changing *now*.

my current adult self is also pretty homesick for arms that may have never even held me. i don’t know who my person is meant to be, or if there's anyone out there at all. will i find someone compatible, who’s also learning to be at peace with themselves, who’s also willing to walk alongside me, good stuff and faults and all? i’m afflicted by the not knowing (it’s excruciating sometimes) (dw i am normal and fine on my own for the most part lol).

anywho, this is it. this is the boundary i’m drawing, the last bit of overthinking what happened. i’ll take it as one of those “didn’t get what i want but got what i need” moments. it's time to let go of illusions of control. i need to take some space for myself and hopefully emerge a little more discerning, a little kinder, a little more patient; someone who doesn’t lash out even when (especially when) they’re upset. the next time i date won't be for a while… but when that time comes—well, i’ll hopefully bleed for better reasons then.

(this is a lot verbal processing lol. and i find a lot of comfort in taylor swift’s music/lyrics, i hope you can tell!!)",3,2,1740851580.0,"i’m afflicted by the not knowing it's me, hi. i’m the common denominator among all my dating attempts that did not turn into partnerships, it's me.

for a while, i thought i had things together. i was getting by and i felt it was a good time to introduce a romantic partner in my life! but beyond the highs of cute and fun dates, it really did feel like i was going through the motions rather than *living*. i look through journals from 2017 and find i’m still writing about some of the same things that brought me anxious feelings. 2024 also brought me a sexy batch of grief, failure, and loss—one after the other. nothing i haven't lived with before ofc, but a binch couldn’t catch a break like PLS.

tbf i did learn a lot about myself through dating; there’s something about having skin in the game that you can’t replicate with just reading about “getting to know people” and “relationship-building.” in some ways though (in my life’s context anyway), dating had been an avenue to numb my aches.

well, i’m going through shit sober now.

long story short, i met someone towards the end of last year; it was going great until it wasn’t. at the lowest point, i felt like an animal, both cornered and abandoned, blindsided by the whiplash. i lashed out in that hurt, crossed lines i shouldn't have, aggravated some really deep cuts with my stupid mouth and angry brain. what went down is between me, my therapist, and god (and the person i’ve offended, of course), but it's awful enough that it plagues me still, pacing in my periphery like a black dog even after i made my sincerest apologies. even after explicitly receiving this person’s forgiveness.

fellas, i had a real dark night of the soul moment with this one ngl. remorse was the fourth horseman for me (grief, loss, and failure being the others). i don’t actually like being someone who lashes out like that. dating someone felt like seeing myself through a mirror, reflecting good and neutral and bad. and for all my faults, i need to set boundaries with myself too—i can’t ruminate on my mistakes indefinitely. catholic guilt is a shitty thing to unlearn, but i need to remember that mistakes are lessons, not life sentences. while they shape me and how i choose to move forward, they don’t have to engulf my identity.

so yes, i am the common denominator among all my dating attempts that did not turn into partnerships. i almost called them ‘failed dating attempts’, but i can't really fail at something if i hadn't given up on it. i did make hard decisions to remove myself from situationships. i did make mistakes that feel irreparable, and i will choose to grow from it because i don't want to repeat it with people i care about. but i’m also a lot more than that??? i can't keep feeding myself stories about how “i ruin everything i touch,” “i cannot trust the person i become when i’m angry,” among other poetic-sounding, self-flagellating crap that become self-fulfilling prophecies.

i need to turn the page. everything i lose is a step i take.

I fully realize that therapy is one of the few realistic options to dig myself out of this, but it just feels so fake. 

I’ve already tried therapy in the past on multiple occasions, both for my mental health and for food sensory issues, neither of which worked at best, and at worst made me feel worse about myself. 

All therapy felt like in the past was a massive gaslight trying to get me to *feel* happy, to trick me into believing that I was happy.

1j09g5h,self,"I get what my problems are, now. But I still fear being right","Lately, I've been using reddit as my personal diary lmao. So I'll try to put my thoughts into words, and see if it helps recognizing exactly what's happening. 

  
I've always feared ending up alone. I don't know if it's because of my mom's own insecurities (that I know she always dumped on me one way or the other), or if it's because I've always felt out of place with every group I've been a part of. But my deepest fear is not finding a person that loves me as I am. 

Since I was a kid, I've always ""acted"". I never felt like my true self. I always faced social situations as if they were a big play, and I was just an actor trying to make it believable. That sentiment has faded away while I grew up and I started realizing that I can be more ""me"" and less whatever I've been until now with some people, but it has never been completely gone.

And the fear of being left alone to rot has always been there. I've faced it by getting into different relationships, even with people that I didn't liked that much at first, just because I thought that it would make me feel more valuable. That it would give me experience and the capacity of being comfortable by knowing that I can be attractive too; that I deserve feeling desired and worthy. But it has always ended badly. My first relationship was a mess, and left me completely broken and even more insecure. The rest... I now feel like they've always been facades. That I endured things for people that I loved, just because I feared that they would run away when they realized how poor my self-perception is. 

And now, after my last breakup, I ended up into the same cycle yet again. I tried contacting with people that I thought could give me what I felt that I needed, but everything felt sickening. I don't want to go behind anyone. I don't want to search for people that don't want me the same way as I do. I was speaking with someone and I just realized ""I'm not getting anything worthy from this conversation. I'm just putting a lot of effort into someone that's not even trying"". So I stopped talking, and they never spoke back. 

I realized that I've been flirting with people, and trying to be open to relationships and sexuality, just because I fear liking being alone. I fear getting used to it, and just not trying anymore. I fear giving up, and getting comfortable with the idea of ending up alone instead of fearing it. So I just stay ""in game"" and going back and forwards into the same mistakes because that way, the sentiment of not being an alien fades away momentarily. But that's not what I want. I don't want to spend my life from relationship to relationship without ever feeling truly loved, and without truly loving anyone, just because my fears make me unable to be alone. 

My plan now is waiting. Trying to improve myself, see what I can achieve by my own. And to hope that sooner or later, I can feel worthy again but because I truly found someone, and not because I threw myself into a relationship with the first person that showed a little bit of attraction towards me.

1j07hzh,self,WTF is that life?,"I'm a 22 male, lucky enough to live comfortably money-wise with my mother. 
We aren't rich but no problems at all.

When I was 19 my grandfather committed suicide after battling cancer. He shot himself in the head.

One year later my best friend (we both were 20) got shot and killed out of no where. 
He was the best person I ever knew- and he just got randomly shot. Never had problems with anyone. Just was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and he died right there.

I had and still have a terrible depression and anxiety since my friend died. I lost 12 kg in a year, I'm on psychiatric meds nowadays, and you know- the whole package.

About 6 months I met the best girl I've ever known- we had a pretty much perfect relationship and we were (and still) deeply in love.
We had one problem on the whole relationship the was occurring due to my mental state.
Yesterday she broke up with claiming she can't keep going like this. I don't blame her, I'm not angry *at her*.

I'm angry about this fucking cruel world that keeps testing me and I can't catch a break.
I messaged my closest friend that we broke up and they didn't even seem to care.
None of my close friend dosent seem to really care and *that* makes me fucking angry.

I know for a fact my friend love me- but I feel like they just lost their morals. 
We were all friends of the late friend and we all got fucked because of it.
I was the closest one to him so naturally it affected me the most.

I just can't understand why when they need me I'm 80-90% of the time there for them.

1j072vd,self,"People with BPD should fix themselves first before going to dating market, your partner isn’t your unpaid psychiatrist","Read some insight about what happened to partners of people with BPD and their caregivers in this
[Harvard systematic review literature.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/s/ejrnoeXKrJ)

I am 32M, but let’s cut the bullshit, dating a woman with Borderline Personality Disorder is emotional self-harm. I wasted four years (2020-2024) trying to “fix” one, and here’s the raw truth nobody wants to admit, BPD isn’t just a disorder it’s a license to manipulate.

She weaponized vulnerability like a pro. Sweet? Intelligent? Sure, until her insecurities turned every conversation into a minefield. One wrong word and she’d shut down, sulking like a child. My empathy was her fuel. Every insecurity I confessed was later twisted into a blade to gut me with. I wasn’t a partner, I was a therapist, a punching bag, and an emotional hostage.  

The suicide threats? Classic BPD extortion. She’d dangle her life to keep me shackled to her bottomless pit of need. And when I couldn’t “fix” her fast enough, she monkey-branched to multiple married men. Not for love for supply. She treated people like utilities, one funded her, another stroked her ego, another absorbed her meltdowns. A fucking trauma dividend portfolio.  

Here’s the cold reality, BPD relationships are emotional Ponzi schemes. They take and take until you’re bankrupt, then move on to the next investor. Narcissists discard you, borderlines consume you. They exploit your pity to justify cruelty, all while Reddit coddles them with “uwu mental health” excuses.  

If you’re an empath, RUN. These relationships aren’t challenging, they’re parasitic. BPD abuse isn’t a flaw, it’s a feature. You can’t love someone out of a personality disorder, and sacrificing yourself won’t make them stable. It just makes you collateral damage.  

Downvote me, call me ableist, I don’t care. Save yourself the therapy bills and avoid this predatory neediness.  

To the “not all BPD” crowds:
Congrats if yours is medicated and self-aware. But the disorder itself thrives on instability. Defending it is like saying “not all landmines.” Some just haven’t exploded yet.

Leaving wasn’t an option. Every time I tried, she’d sprint into traffic, threaten to jump in front of trains, or slice her wrists for show (once even doing it for real, though not deep and wide enough to finish the job), I assure you it's scary.

The only way I escaped was by nuking both our reputations while I was away. I leaked proof of her affairs with married men, screenshots of her verbally abusing me, and bombarded her with daily messages for two weeks straight, not threats, just cold, blunt truths “You’re the problem.

Our breakup was  so confusing because she never actually broke up with me she just talked to me less and less until the last time we saw each other and had a giant fight. If that wasn't bad enough she cheated on me leading up to this but I just ignored it like an idiot. She found a new boyfriend so fast and I had just figured id never hear from her again, especially because the last thing she told me was she doesn't miss me at all and to kill myself. Nothing in my life has ever made me feel as worthless as she had towards the end of our relationship. The worst part is even 3 years later I am always thinking about her. 

Anyways, this fall in October I got a follow request from her instagram and she sent me a dm. I got really excited, after all I missed my person and I wanted us to be in each other's lives again. However, she never really messaged me and would say she misses me and that she wants to see and call me, but whenever I tell her I would come see her anytime. When she did call me, she usually only stayed for 10 mins and would make up an excuse to hang out. This brought up a lot of feelings I don't think I really took care of in a healthy way. She would tell me she only had an ipad as well but I knew she had a phone. Throughout this period of us talking again she's acting kind of shady, lying about having no phone, and she's hanging out with other men who look to be in there 30s. I got upset that she kept lying to me and I asked her if she would wanna hang out  last month. She completely ignored my message and instead just messaged me saying she's breaking her friend out of rehab. That was the last time I talked to her for another month until 2 weeks ago she sent me a DM and told me her phone was broken and she just got back into her accounts. I told her not to worry bout it and I hope shes doing alright but she hasn't answered that message in 2 weeks 

I really don't know what to do guys. I've wanted her back in my life so bad and when she tells me she misses me and wants to see me, and that she still finds me handsome it reminds me of how much I still love her. I'm no fool, I know she's playing games with me but I also know she's been going through some shit. She tried to get sober and then relapsed, and she was also arrested over the summer. Can anyone offer me any advice? I'm obsessing over her once again and I kind of hate the way it feels. This is someone I haven't known in 3 years, I don't even think we are the same people anymore. I still love her. I fell for her so hard and we tatted eachothers names on ourselves, and I've just never felt this way about someone before. It makes me feel a little sick how addicted I am to attention from her and all it takes is a small message. I know I got my own problems, but a relationship with her is something I value.

There is still real hurt in me from how she treated me and obviously it's something we would have to work out, but I don't think she values me enough to do that, and I also don't think it's something on her mind rn with her own personal struggles.

I am able to not behave badly towards others and have decent boundaries, but the pain I experience on the inside is terrible.

1j7aso9,BPD,BPD isn’t inherently worse than other mental health disorders,"I know BPD is considered to be the most painful mental health disorder and the statistics show that suicide is more common for pwBPD. I’m not at all denying that BPD is a completely debilitating and painful condition. I feel like my world is crashing in every day and I can barely function!

I guess my frustration is that I keeping seeing people online use BPD as a “my struggle is more than someone with MDD, GAD, BiPD, OCD, etc”. That’s kind of just a symptom of the internet, but it’s such a silly generalization. 

People end their lives over MDD. People with MDD are on disability because they can’t keep a job. They can be in and out of inpatient care. They can have addictions and self harm. There is so much individual variation in how people experience their mental health that you can’t say “I knew I had BPD because I had such severe SH and I was admitted so many times as a child”. Some people with BPD have never been admitted. 

My sister has OCD and she was admitted for months of her childhood, had to switch between specialized behavioral schools 3 times, can’t drive, is on disability, and we are pursuing getting her in a facility where she can have professionals care for her around the clock. Some people with OCD are completely independent in adulthood. A lot of people with BPD, including myself, are way more independent than my sister. That’s not to say I am not at a greater risk for intentional suicide (she is unintentionally a danger to herself and others), but our experiences are so different that it’s not remotely feasible nor helpful to compare severity. 

There’s no competition if we are all struggling in our own minds. I wish I would stop seeing people say “just” depression or “just” anxiety. Those things have such a spectrum of severity. It feels like the diagnoses have become so common that people forget how severe they can present. It seems everyone had depression/anxiety and while I don’t know what’s going on in everyone’s private life, the majority of people who talk about mental illness don’t seem to be representative of how bad things can get. 

I have a family member who has anxiety about sharing a bathroom and can only relieve themself in jars. That is not romanticized the way being nervous about asking for no pickle is.

i’m a 17 yr old girl (turning 18 very very soon), and my fp is my teacher. i feel so embarrassed that i feel so close and obsessed with him. i don’t think anybody could be able to understand the type of bond and feelings i have for him. he was my psychology teacher last year, but he also teaches other social science classes so i asked for his gov/econ class this year. 

but my obsession for him is huge and such a big issue and i know it is, but i see him as my dad. he’s always nice to me and he’s always supportive and helpful and just so kind. he listens to me all the time and answers my questions, he’s the one who said i should be a clinical psychologist because i love psychology so much. he’s listened to me vent so many times, he’s seen me at some of my lowest and highest points. even when i so very obviously ignored him for whole weeks like twice he was so kind about it. even when i wrote him a letter just basically saying how awful he was for betraying me, he still cared about me. he knows more about me and my mental health issues then my parents and friends. 

sometimes tho i see him as a boyfriend and imagine us doing couple things or kissing, and i have lots of dreams about this stuff too. even though he’s like 59 and has a wife and kids. i just can’t stop thinking about him

last year i memorized his walk path in the mornings just so i could always smile at him in the hallways. one time he didn’t smile back and i felt suicidal, empty, depressed, paranoid, and so many other emotions for 2 days straight. it felt like i had no point in living and i was hollow, until monday came around and he smiled at me. i get angry and jealous when i see him talk with other students, it feels like he’s neglecting me. whenever im upset i imagine having a conversation with him and comforting me. even when im mad i imagine myself lashing out horribly, but my BPD is more so quiet bpd so i guess that may also explain that. i’m also constantly jealous of his wife and family i just block them out and wouldn’t care if anything happened to them. he’s a pretty bad person with some questionable things but i always ignore it, unless talking shit about him to sort of “punish him” or make sure other people won’t get too close with him. i have invisible competitions with so many classmates because of the fear he’ll leave me for another person, even though we aren’t even together. i remember crying heavily one day because i saw new papers hung up on his board and thought he hung up another students gift when he hasn’t even hung up a drawing i gave him last year, i felt so rejected and i hated him. he’s the worst.  

i’m also so sensitive to criticism, like most, and i couldn’t look at the grades u gave me for my term paper drafts (even tho he graded harshly on EVERYONE) when i finally read mine after like 5 days of procrastination i cried so much and felt like suicidal. i even cut the grade he gave me on my thigh. until i got my grade for the final draft of the essay and even though i got a B-, he complimented mine the most multiple times. it made me feel so completely loved and on top of the world. 

sometimes i feel as though when i graduate i’ll be completely empty and hollow, like i have no lifelong, since i wont get to see him almost everyday. sometimes i think i should just hospitalize myself so i don’t have to live through having to experience that.

ik there was another student last year who had a similar thing but she was way way way more straight forward about it, even writing him love letters and hugging him, coming on campus when she left the school, etc. and it’s made me become more impulsive (according to my therapist), thinking if she can do all that shit why can’t i? why can’t i tell him i love him and need him? why can’t i tell him whatever she felt i feel 100x stronger and better ???

there’s just so much i can say about him and all my obsessional thoughts, issues, and instances with him. this has been happening for at least a year now too. but it would be too long for this post. i just feel so depressed and empty knowing i wont have him with me forever. part of me hopes maybe when i turn 18 he’ll admit his feelings towards me, even if it’s not romantic, just feelings of paternal love. but i think if he did give me that i might get grossed out and almost insecure. i also am quick to also dismiss the said awful/questionable things he might have done because i also can’t connect to the situation on an emotional/empathetic level. 

it took me forever to open up about this relationship with my teacher due to my therapist working at the school and being so afraid she would try to stop contact with eachother. luckily that hasn’t happened but it still makes me terrified about saying the right or wrong thing. especially since my relationship with him influences all my bpd symptoms (obviously), but if i hide talking about him i wont be able to express so much of my bpd issues ",1,0,1741473650.0,"obsession with my teacher / fp (CW: self harm + suicidal ideation) venting and seeking some support or advice, if any

i’m also so sensitive to criticism, like most, and i couldn’t look at the grades u gave me for my term paper drafts (even tho he graded harshly on EVERYONE) when i finally read mine after like 5 days of procrastination i cried so much and felt like suicidal. i even cut the grade he gave me on my thigh. until i got my grade for the final draft of the essay and even though i got a B-, he complimented mine the most multiple times. it made me feel so completely loved and on top of the world. 

sometimes i feel as though when i graduate i’ll be completely empty and hollow, like i have no lifelong, since i wont get to see him almost everyday. sometimes i think i should just hospitalize myself so i don’t have to live through having to experience that.

ik there was another student last year who had a similar thing but she was way way way more straight forward about it, even writing him love letters and hugging him, coming on campus when she left the school, etc. and it’s made me become more impulsive (according to my therapist), thinking if she can do all that shit why can’t i? why can’t i tell him i love him and need him? why can’t i tell him whatever she felt i feel 100x stronger and better ???

there’s just so much i can say about him and all my obsessional thoughts, issues, and instances with him. this has been happening for at least a year now too. but it would be too long for this post. i just feel so depressed and empty knowing i wont have him with me forever. part of me hopes maybe when i turn 18 he’ll admit his feelings towards me, even if it’s not romantic, just feelings of paternal love. but i think if he did give me that i might get grossed out and almost insecure. i also am quick to also dismiss the said awful/questionable things he might have done because i also can’t connect to the situation on an emotional/empathetic level. 

it took me forever to open up about this relationship with my teacher due to my therapist working at the school and being so afraid she would try to stop contact with eachother. luckily that hasn’t happened but it still makes me terrified about saying the right or wrong thing. especially since my relationship with him influences all my bpd symptoms (obviously), but if i hide talking about him i wont be able to express so much of my bpd issues ",1.0297447825042854,0.1038604189570057,Negative,High-Risk

1j6hw2h,BPD,Craving Praise so much that it physically hurts,"CW: Self Harm, Substance Abuse  


Lately I \[19F\] have been struggling so goddamn much. I was doing okay mentally. The last time something big bad happened was on new years last year (Ended up in hospital after an overdose). Since then I had only cut once or twice (Unfortunately for the first time those scars never faded). Nothing since October though.  
  
Over the past month though, with the arrival of bad news, my mental state has worsened. I have also begun to notice an overwhelming craving for praise. I need it so bad that it hurts. Like cramps. Like a hollow stomach after a week of not being able to afford food. It hurts worse than a sucker punch to the guts. I have a constant ache in my chest and I am just left there curled up on my bed crying because its never enough. I try to praise myself. My nan always tells me I do a good job; almost too much. It isn't enough.

\*\*\*This craving isn't kink based\*\*\* I feel like I need someone to tell me I am a good girl, that they are proud of me and what I have done. I need to be told I am beautiful and amazing. But it feels like nobody is special enough. Its not enough because even though my nan is amazing, I love her so much. She isn't the right person I think because she kinda has to be in my life. She isn't a close friend or partner. There isn't a chosen relationship.

I am not medicated at the moment due to an inability to swallow pills right now (Possibly related to the hospital trip), and I'm also not seeing a therapist (Last wasn't kink/LGBTQIA+ Friendly). And I don't know if that has any relation because it has been that way for over 6 months now.

I don't know what happened that changed or if it is simply a massive change in mood and I feel like this is a stupid question but... has anyone experienced the same? What do I do? I feel so lost and it just hurts so much.

I remember the first time I got attached to someone, her name was Clara, I was 12. I would center myself around her everywhere I went I was like a lost dog following her around. I was always close to her and at times when I couldnt be I would right about her. I spent 2-4 hours a day writing about her. (No this is not an exaggeration) I kept a stupid drawing she gave me and I would look at it for hours while writing about her. She really meant the entire world but the thing is, she didn’t care about me whatsoever. She actually found me really annoying and I knew that I just needed to be in her presence. I was so incredibly attached to her that everything she did impacted everything i did. If she cut herself I’d do it too, if she starved herself i’d do it too.
She started to push me away at the end of the year so I completely ghosted her and never talked to her since. I’ve had many many relationships like that. I get so incredibly attached and when I do I tend to engage in more self destructive behaviors to get their attention. (I have self harmed since I was 8, but began cutting at 11.) i have threaten to commit suicide many many times, whenever I feel that someone is going to leave I tell them I’ll kill myself and beg with all my power for them to stay. If they don’t I then start pointing out all their mistakes and insecuritys they have as a way to defend myself. I’ll tell them everything theyve done to me and play victim. I don’t have much empathy at all. Sometimes I am able to feel everything but most of the time I lack empathy. Except for when I’m attached to someone (i would call them my fp but I feel like thats a term only people with bpd can say and I dont want to come off as rude) I also do a thing where I do things that annoy people on purpose so they will leave me and hate me. Like for example their was this girl named Brinley and we previously had a conversation about how I “mess up everything” (which is actually true and she was point facts) and I kept saying I do nothing wrong because I wanted to seem toxic so she would leave me. I do that a lot. I find it much easier than leaving people instead I make them leave me. I also have engaged in substance abuse many times to get attention and just because. I have od’d on OTC meds for euphoria and to get high I’ve also done weed and drank many times even in school. I have gotten in physical fights before, once someone starts talking about me I sometimes lose control and start throwing hands. I am constantly seeking thrill in things and I do manipulate and gaslight others a lot. I lie about almost everything for attention, I lie about my past to make it seem more serious than it was to feel valid. In my mind nothing is bad unless you get caught. I have broken the law before, Ive shoplifted and have made serious death threats. I know part of BPD revolves childhood trauma but I genuinely don’t remember anything from my childhood. I don’t remember my mom being there a lot and I was sa’d a few times but other than that I really don’t have a memory of it.  Also I am not proud of any of the shit I do, this post is not tp brag whatsoever I absolutely hate how I act.

1j639kc,BPD,boyfriend broke up with me because of bpd part 2,"This is mostly a vent post but there are mentions of self harm here !!! Just a small warning before reading.

I think I may actually be losing it lol. I feel like I've constantly been on auto pilot ever since what happened. I feel so conflicted because my thoughts are now completley different from the ones I had previously. I've started to get more and more angry as time goes by and I don't like it. I want to stay sympathetic and understanding that he did what he had to do, but I can't seem to stop myself from getting so angry about it now. Why did he have to betray me like that? I feel so frustrated and sad. I'm still so hurt over the fact that he was the one I had the most trust in and wanted support from, but he couldn't understand or even try to comprehend how my bpd works and why it's such a hard thing for me to go through. I can't truly blame him because I know you don't have an obligation to help someone thats mentally ill if it's also starting to affect you too.

the past 1 and a half days, I haven't been able to sleep or eat much. I've resorted to distracting myself completely so I won't have the time to end up destroying myself. But It's already starting, and it's so hard to help myself. The max sleep I have gotten is about 5 hours, that were seperated by naps for each day. I lost my appetite really badly, but the one meal I finally convinced myself to have, I couldn't even finish. My thoughts were consuming me and I started to feel sick. It made my appetite even worse than it already was. 

I had to be out for most of yesterday, and it felt like I was going to explode. I couldn't function or think properly anymore. I'd start staring into the distance and let myself be consumed by my own negative thoughts, and I hate it. I kept subconsciously putting my hands on my face and arms, thinking about how I should just rip and claw my skin off so I'd at least feel something other than the loud thoughts in my head. But since I was in public, and needed to keep my composure and it felt so suffocating. So many people around but I was so alone. 

I feel like I'm going insane. I couldn't get myself to cry about it even when I try to (Which is actually very weird and almost concerning, because usually whenever I'm going through a situation like this, I would always cry for hours on end. I could wake up crying in the morning and I'll do the rest of my day while still sobbing).  It doesn't feel real at all. During my distractions and while I'm out, I feel like I'm constantly about to burst into tears or into a fit of rage, but never get there. But once I'm home and can finally let it all out, I can't seem to. It feels like I'm so sensitive to it all but also numb at the same time. It's so tiring to be like this every single day.

Back when I used to be worse at handling episodes like this, I would end up scratching my face and arms until it got red or started bleeding. And now I am scared that I'm thinking about doing it again whenever I get really triggered by remembering something he said. I feel so frustrated and angry. I don't know if its towards him or me anymore, but I know for sure I'll end up taking it out on myself. I'm doing all that I can to stop myself from going back but it's so hard. I want to get better and learn to cope in a healthy way about this, but everything just hurts I can't think right anymore.

While I was thinking about it again, I remembered that I had plans and dreams with him. I wanted to someday get married with him and have a happy life together. And for the first time ever, I wanted to have kids someday. I trusted and loved him so much that I would've wanted a family with him, and was comfortable thinking about it because he was so sweet and caring. The thought of him being the father made me feel so warm. Realizing I can't have that with him anymore finally made me break down into tears.
I'm so angry that maybe he did cheat on me with that girl. I can't help but jump to conclusions but in the end, I still can't blame him. Why wouldn't he want someone else that's more mentally stable and he could genuinely be happy with?

I feel like I'm grieving the life I could've had with him if I was just normal. It hurts everyday to have this illness with me. It's been like this for years and I am dreading the fact that it will be here to stay for the rest of my life. Will the thoughts always be this loud? The next time I fall in love again, will it destroy that too? I can't help but mourn the person I could've been if I didn't have bpd. It's ruined my life, and I'm so upset that I genuinely can't imagine how a normal person's thought process should be like. Living like this has been all I've ever known. I hate that even if I can manage to control my actions and be self conscious of how I manage and go about my illness, I will never be free of the emotional turmoil either way.

1j5zolg,BPD,"Terrible Intrusive Thoughts, Please help","

Hi guys, I am wondering what your experiences are with intrusive thoughts.
I don't have any thoughts about killing people or pedophilia or anything, it is purely things that happened to me and things I did in the past.
It is like this jolting, stabbing pain, and I often image a gun to my head to make it go away. I'm not suicidal. I am just feeling so much shame and pain for the things I've done that I feel, in those moments, that I deserve to die. Or the embarrassment is so much that I can't stand it. I'll occasionally hit myself. I usually cry out in pain, scream, jolt, grimace, or say I hate myself (or other abusive words to myself)

These thoughts range from episodes I’ve had in front of people, cringe things I’ve done, people leaving me, my SA trauma, home life abuse and neglect, etc. Sometimes theres not even a visual, my brain like just knows I’m supposed to hate myself in that moment and triggers the stabbing pain. I’m so tired of how much pain I’m in.

I’m high functioning in public, so I usually just grimace or jolt. I feel bad when I talk to people because it looks like I’m grimacing at them but literally just imagining how my ex partner’s mom hated me (which was my fault) haha

The things I’ve done are inexcusable, but I know I don’t deserve the amount of chronic pain I am in because of everything (and some of it isnt even my fault!) 

I have these thoughts at least a few times an hour. Does anyone with BPD have anything similar? I'm not sure if these are symptoms of BPD or OCD but probably CTPTSD. I'm going to talk to my therapist soon.",12,4,1741379818.0,"Terrible Intrusive Thoughts, Please help

1j5si5s,BPD,How can i get my impulses better under control? My life seems to drift,"**TLDR:** Very impulsive, starting to get more and more self-detrimental / self-harming, scared there could be something majorly wrong with me. Last fuck-up was a very vulgar tattoo on the middle of my tigh.

I have always been a very impulsive person. Whenever I wanted something, I wanted it now - whenever I had an idea for something, I went for it immediately. Some examples of the last (roughly) 10 years (I'm 27 now):

\- I was in education for a job that I wanted to do since I was a child. It started to feel uncomfortable so instead of driving with my car to the school place from my parents, I drove to the airport in the middle of the night and flew to Spain for a weekend (explained it to them later, cancelled the education).  
\- When I wanted to go to university, I have written myself in, but never went there because of anxiety.  
\- Often, when I travel, I decide for it very spontaneously. Sometimes even some hours before departure.  
\- I have tried so, so many different jobs and I'm happy that I am holding my current job since October 2024. (I tried train conductor, plane traffic manager, several academic studies and I was self employed for 5 years - the thing that worked very well)  
\- I usually don't work after a stringent plan, but more after motivation.  
\- When I was starting to go out with 15/16, I had emotional overdrives when I was drunk. Sometimes I'd run away from the group and would start crying somewhere in a corner because I felt lonely (idk what that is lol)  
\- I have extreme emotions (especially when it comes to anxiety, but I have worked a lot in therapy which helps me to lead a somehow normal life)

These are some examples, which aren't so extreme yet (I think) but it all intensified last year. I felt a little bit depressed in winter so I got on Bupropion (Wellbutrin). I think it worked too well for me and I came into a little bit of a crazy state.

First, I started working out rigorously and also left my then-boyfriend. A week later, I quit my well-paid software developer job and decided to start delivering food by bike. It felt nice because it was the first time I could let out all the pent-up-energy in my body. 

I think at this time I was full-on-hypomanic. I met a guy from a close city on Tinder and we would start having an extremely intense, romantic situationship. It was crazy and after 2-3 weeks he asked me if we want to be together, I said yes. Not long after I noticed that he did not only infect me with Syphilis, but also he was very narcisisstic and used me rather for validation than for true love, which hurt a lot and this was the first time I wanted to take sleep pills and never wake up again.

After I got my STD cleared up, I met a lot of guys for casual sexual or intimate encounters and luckily enough, I got a little bit calmer in September and found a new IT job in fall. However, energy was building up, and I decided I want to do big changes to my body, so I flew to another country to have something major done to my body (surgery that changed my voice - I spent all my savings on it) and I got my first tattoo. At this time I stopped telling my friends because they had enough of my erratic behavior.

Now, I got a new tattoo with a very vulgar text on my tigh. I thought its funny and I felt alive when I did it, but now - only 4 days later - I see that I have to change something. I am chasing weird highs and I'm not able to live calmly and normally anymore.

What if I do even crazier stuff in the future? I would say this is very self detrimental and self harming at this point. I want to have a normal career and a chill life and maybe build something for myself. But with this behavior, I know I will scare off many potential people in my life. 

Right now, I struggle with loneliness a lot sometimes. Also, normal reactions from people on myself will put me in a downward spiral. Sometimes a wrong look of a person is enough to make me feel like I'm the worst.

However, I don't know how to change, and I'm scared it could be borderline. When I was in a very bad state I went to another psychiatrist, he asked me a lot of questions and then said that everything points to borderline... The tattoo I will partly remove, to leave the illustration but remove the vulgar text...

Is change possible at this point? At 27, for the first time, I'm getting scared for my future because I really, really want to build a stable and normal life and not be lonely.",2,0,1741364671.0,"How can i get my impulses better under control?

So for the first like 2 months of dating I just considered it not real like I just split and nothing mattered because I was just emotionally numb to everything- I really wanted to get to three months of dating someone because I know that’s when most people break up and I have never had a relationship before so I wanted to get to that benchmark before ending it. A problem I have is that I need people to reject me so that it’s not my fault even though I make it IMPOSSIBLE to stay by my side. My partner stayed by my side even though I ghosted them for days up to a week and repeatedly telling them that they don’t matter to me. Eventually it got to a sticking point where they broke up with me and I felt so much better (even though I was really sad) and I went into my therapy session and my therapist basically asked me if I thought I made progress in doing that and if I was really doing what I wanted. Which obviously was confusing because I didn’t break up with this person they broke up with me but after realizing all the different ways I tried to kick this person out they just gave up (honestly should’ve stayed that way) I called them after therapy to at least apologize and they took me back right away saying they knew it wasn’t my fault and that I was in psychosis at the time (which I obviously definitely was). After then I realized I actually really do care and like this person and I regret so much how I treated them. A month later my actions changed a little but I also was still in a manic state so it wasn’t that big of an improvement (acknowledging my efforts while still realizing it might not be enough for this person). They went out drinking on Saturday and called me at 12am to break up with me- I said no we should do it in person when you aren’t drunk. So they came over the next day and I started to say everything I’d been thinking. They still wanted to break up with me but I said no again. I kinda get why I did that but I can’t tell if I’m being selfish because I don’t want to lose them, or if I’m genuinely trying to give our relationship the same chance that they gave me. We haven’t talked since then because I asked them to rethink breaking up because there was so much new information to process. We haven’t spoken since then (4days) which again is somewhat normal and I think important while we try and figure out what we need. 
I feel that we are similar in so many ways but I can’t tell if I’m projecting my hurt and pain and stuff from my own life and holding onto this person.

1j5ghna,BPD,I’m tired of trying,"I’ve been completely sober for years, I do (usually intense) exercise daily, I’m successful in my schooling/career, I spend money wisely and am not impulsive at all. I’ve been in therapy for years. BPD is a recent realization, but I’ve had the symptoms in all of my relationships - almost all of which I’ve exhausted before they hit a year. My psychiatrist told me that I’m “doing everything right,” but that couldn’t feel further from the truth. 

I’m at the 10 month mark with a guy that I genuinely think could be a life partner. Outside of BPD, I feel so secure. We share goals, values and hobbies; he’s had similar, unique life experiences as I; he’s a really kind, patient person. Within BPD - I’m verbally abusive, I’m insanely critical and fearful, and I expect him to fix how I feel, because I can’t. It’s so irrational, yet unstoppable. And the emotional pain is so, so real. 

I know I’ll wake up tomorrow and try again. Go to work and keep up with some of my adult responsibilities. Keep trying to get into a DBT program and keep taking meds and keep telling myself that I’m not someone who self harms anymore. But then it’s only a matter of time before this all will hit me again. 

I feel like there are so few success stories, and an easy - or even just stable - relationship is completely out of reach for me. I feel so hopeless.

She became quite emotionally dull, therefore I started to be scared of losing her. I expressed my joy way too strongly and vented to her way too much( couldn't control myself, even though I knew I should not do it, because she wanted to just chill, figure stuff out) and acted obsessive, which became really draining for her and told me that she needs a pause and go no-contact and to not talk to me at the moment (no idea how long is that supposed to be). People in the past used to punish me by pausing our conversation for a few days, so it hits extra hard, but in this case I am really worried that she'll just figure out that her life is better without me and will never come back.

1j57b32,BPD,I need advice TW,"first of all, hello - silent reader here.

I was diagnosed in 2019, 5 months after my father died of cancer at the age of 43. I was 24 at the time and had only been in therapy once before that for a few months for an anxiety disorder. At that time, however, there was no talk of BPD (also because the therapy was never very intensive and I never wanted to talk about my childhood or adolescence)



I had a difficult childhood - neglect/psychological violence in particular.



But symptoms were there very early on - from about the age of 12. It was mainly about feelings of inferiority, fears, very strong fears of loss in friendships and then in my first romantic relationships. With my first boyfriend, the jealousy and addiction to control was very bad...



Looking back, it all makes sense now. But the really bad symptoms only came on when my father - my only caregiver (he had nothing to do with anything from my childhood. My parents separated when I was 5 and I lived with my mother). So the symptoms started in 2019 - severe depression, aggressive obsessive thoughts, suicidal thoughts, restlessness, tension. Of course, I then sought psychiatric treatment, where I was also hospitalized several times - and also received medication (Lexapro, Seroquel, lithium). 



I also found a good therapist in 2020 who I still see today. She helped me a lot to understand. So I am very happy with her. 



I feel the need to get some advice here - as my phases change very often again.



I have to say that at first there was talk of bipolar 2 - but after 2 years of therapy it turned out to be BPD. 



Is it normal for borderliners to have depressive phases with mild psychotic symptoms so often? What about obsessive thoughts? In 2024 I only had one really big depressive phase and otherwise only minor ones. 2025 started badly and now I've had another extremely bad phase for 2 weeks. 



I'm afraid it won't stop... and these obsessive thoughts are terrible. You're afraid of your own thoughts...



I also have 2 children aged 7 and 9 - my husband supports me wherever he can, but he also has to work. We are dependent on his money because I can't go to work. 



I need encouragement.  Please

1j51p0y,BPD,He’s breaking up with me because I’m depressed.,"My partner, who I thought is finally the one, is breaking up with me because I’m too suicidal. I’ve been doing great but just not now actually. I’ve just been depressed lately because I lost my job, am having a creative block, am broke to sustain my lifestyle, and am graduating soon so I’m having an existential crisis. 

He was, apparently, getting tired of me. He says that everytime I get down or am crashing. I asked him what’s so tiring about it, it’s because he wants to ‘fix’ me and he can’t. I tried communicating that I’m not someone who can be fixed and it’s not like he can cure me by making me smile once. He told me he has his needs too, and then I asked what kind of needs? He told me some positive energy would help and it triggered me. Because all this time I’ve been avoiding telling him the gory things in my head on how I want to die to protect him and yet he wants me to be ‘positive’ even if I want to literally kill myself. I told him he just has to stay, all I need is for him to stay. But apparently he’s getting tired of ‘just staying’ and ‘just listening’ because he wants to fix me. 

I let him get the best of me, we got together when I got shit figured out and now he’s leaving me as soon as I start crashing. It fucking hurts. I don’t know what I need rn, honestly. I thought this guy would be ‘the one’, after not believing in love for so many years even if I’ve had other exes. For the first time in many years, I wanted to actually marry him and (oh my god this is so out of character but) have kids with him. I thought I finally found the one. But apparently he just wants butterflies and sunshine in a relationship. Ending it might be the best thing but it’s so fucking painful I can barely function. I opened up my heart again for this man, which was probably a mistake. I don’t think I can believe in love ever again after this.

1j51cyk,BPD,my boyfriend broke up with me,"Just a warning that by the end of this post, there'll be some mentions of self harm !!!


He left me today because of my bpd unfortunately. Back before we officially started dating , I cleared it up with him that I have mental issues and I won't be the easiest to deal with and that if ever it gets too much for him , I wont blame him for leaving or prioritizing himself. Today he finally did it because it become too much for him. 

To clear things up, we've never argued before. Whenever there was a conflict or something that upset one of us, we would always go to eachother to fix it and communicate properly. We were a healthy relationship and I was the happiest I have ever been with him, because I had found someone that genuinely loved me so much and was willing to help me through my problems. If I was overthinking something or felt as if I was going to do something impulsive bad for me or us, I'd go to him if it became too much for me to manage on my own.

We were together for a almost a year like that, and what I would usually do is just try to self soothe myself because I was always reassured that he wouldn't leave me or do anything bad to hurt me. I had a tendency to be clingy or overthink a lot because of my past trauma, along with being cheated on by past partners or being abandoned because they grow tired of me. I went to him for reassurance if ever it gets too much for me to handle on my own and I'd always be so happy that he was willing to help me, I was thankful to him that he was understanding of me but every now and then I'd remind him that if it does get too much, he can leave and prioritize himself. I loved him too much to make him stay if he was unhappy with me.

Today he had enough I guess. For context, these past 2 weeks he had been mentioning a girl that he was getting close with and I didn't say anything at first, because I didn't want to seem irrational. I wanted to approach it in a healthy way cause I know he would never do anything bad, but I always cannot help but want some form of reassurance at least. He cleared it up, but I brought up the fact that I'm upset because sometimes I just cannot think rationally about something, even if logically I know nothing is wrong. I told this to him because as much as I am happy with him, I somehow can't help but feel so intensely or just depressed about some things. He finally told me that he doesn't understand how in the 1 year we have been together, I haven't gotten rid of these intense feelings. 

I had to explain that I can't cure my bpd. I can soothe myself if it gets too hard, and I can control what I can and shouldn't do in those situations. I do split on him from time to time if he says anything that would accidentally trigger me, but I never take it out on him or anyone cause I know in the moment that I just need to manage it and have some sort of support so I won't do anything impulsive. And I think in his perspective, being able to ""manage"" my bpd means my intense emotions will go away completely. I had to tell him that I won't be able to get rid of it just like that, what I can control is if I'll take out my anger on him, do things that purposely hurt him or us and leave with no warning. Which I don't.

I think his expectation was that someday, I'll be normal. Someday I won't be overthinking and be depressed all the time. Someday I'll be someone that he can find easy to love without wanting to change a thing about. I truly wish I could be like that. I didn't stop him from leaving cause as hard as it is to be mentally ill, I know it's difficult to help someone that has it too. I don't want to stress him out anymore by being with me.

I understand him completely, but I can't help but just breakdown at the thought that once again, I've been proven that I'm difficult to love. Me being so happy with him and constantly reassured made it so my symptoms actually lessened. But now I just feel so defeated at the fact that it wasn't enough. I just wish I could be normal and be someone he could actually find it easy to be with. I feel so hopeless and I feel like I will never find someone that was willing to love me like that ever again.

I used to do self harm whenever I'd go through intense situations, and when I was with him I managed not to do anything extremely bad cause I know I had his support to help me cope properly, and It would make him sad to see me like that. Now that he's gone, I can't help but just want to hurt myself as punishment for not being what he wanted. I know I'll eventually get over it, but it feels like the end of the world for me now and I know the support from my friends won't be enough to completely get rid of this pain. 

It would've been our 1 year anniversary about 2-3 weeks from now and it just hurts that I couldn't even make someone stay for that full year with me. I hope someday he'll be with someone he can happily love without any problems.

edit: Hi so I didn't expect this post to actually get so many responses lol, I only wanted to put my feelings somewhere so I won't explode and do anything irrational. Thank you all for the support and wishes, I truly appreciate it !!! I will try to respond to some so I can clear some things up that I didn't get to mention in the post. :>

I went to him for reassurance if ever it gets too much for me to handle on my own and I'd always be so happy that he was willing to help me, I was thankful to him that he was understanding of me but every now and then I'd remind him that if it does get too much, he can leave and prioritize himself. I loved him too much to make him stay if he was unhappy with me.

Today he had enough I guess. For context, these past 2 weeks he had been mentioning a girl that he was getting close with and I didn't say anything at first, because I didn't want to seem irrational. I wanted to approach it in a healthy way cause I know he would never do anything bad, but I always cannot help but want some form of reassurance at least. He cleared it up, but I brought up the fact that I'm upset because sometimes I just cannot think rationally about something, even if logically I know nothing is wrong. I told this to him because as much as I am happy with him, I somehow can't help but feel so intensely or just depressed about some things. He finally told me that he doesn't understand how in the 1 year we have been together, I haven't gotten rid of these intense feelings. 

I had to explain that I can't cure my bpd. I can soothe myself if it gets too hard, and I can control what I can and shouldn't do in those situations. I do split on him from time to time if he says anything that would accidentally trigger me, but I never take it out on him or anyone cause I know in the moment that I just need to manage it and have some sort of support so I won't do anything impulsive. And I think in his perspective, being able to ""manage"" my bpd means my intense emotions will go away completely. I had to tell him that I won't be able to get rid of it just like that, what I can control is if I'll take out my anger on him, do things that purposely hurt him or us and leave with no warning. Which I don't.

I think his expectation was that someday, I'll be normal. Someday I won't be overthinking and be depressed all the time. Someday I'll be someone that he can find easy to love without wanting to change a thing about. I truly wish I could be like that. I didn't stop him from leaving cause as hard as it is to be mentally ill, I know it's difficult to help someone that has it too. I don't want to stress him out anymore by being with me.

I understand him completely, but I can't help but just breakdown at the thought that once again, I've been proven that I'm difficult to love. Me being so happy with him and constantly reassured made it so my symptoms actually lessened. But now I just feel so defeated at the fact that it wasn't enough. I just wish I could be normal and be someone he could actually find it easy to be with. I feel so hopeless and I feel like I will never find someone that was willing to love me like that ever again.

I used to do self harm whenever I'd go through intense situations, and when I was with him I managed not to do anything extremely bad cause I know I had his support to help me cope properly, and It would make him sad to see me like that. Now that he's gone, I can't help but just want to hurt myself as punishment for not being what he wanted. I know I'll eventually get over it, but it feels like the end of the world for me now and I know the support from my friends won't be enough to completely get rid of this pain. 

It would've been our 1 year anniversary about 2-3 weeks from now and it just hurts that I couldn't even make someone stay for that full year with me. I hope someday he'll be with someone he can happily love without any problems.

edit: Hi so I didn't expect this post to actually get so many responses lol, I only wanted to put my feelings somewhere so I won't explode and do anything irrational. Thank you all for the support and wishes, I truly appreciate it !!! I will try to respond to some so I can clear some things up that I didn't get to mention in the post. :>

TRIGGER WARNING FOR SELF HARM AND JUST CRAZY STUPID RANTING 



The other night, I had to explain to the girl I was talking to that yes i liked her a lot but i absolutely cannot handle a relationship without therapy. and then I just went off the fucking handles. I messaged my best friend just ranting. i’d guess over 300 messages in 3 hours, barely exaggerating. I kept saying stuff like “I know you hate me, why do you stay?” and other horrible self harm threats so he’d stay. HE didn’t reject me but all of the anger i felt went right to him. I purged everything off of my account and soft blocked everybody  i know including my mother EXCEPT for him. 

i am SO god damn lucky that he understands because he was so patient and sweet and even after was very kind about it but i am beyond ashamed. some of the things i said make me sick. I also cut off a lot of my hair, my arms, i cut the heads off of my favourite stuffed animals, cut up some other things i own, i was going absolutely crazy with the scissors I had. I was throwing shit around my room and just losing it. This hasn’t happened in so long. I used to be this bad but for this to happen now makes me literally physically sick. 

   I sometimes spiral a little bit but i always just feel my body click and it goes away. That whole time i was expecting to just click off but i didn’t. I was so angry and so bitter and i was just trying to make everybody leave em but when they didn’t I got angry. Why the fuck am I like this? Why? Why do people still love me?

1j4j7aa,BPD,How do you make therapy easier? Or make it even work at all?,"I've been going through a particularly hard time lately. I've been depressed, extra irritable, and I nearly relapsed into alcoholism. My boyfriend suggested I try therapy again because he thinks I need professional help, but he also said he didn't really expect me to do it anyway because I've had a hard time with therapy in the past. 

Every time I've been to therapy before, I've found myself falling into the habit of lying to my therapist about how I'm doing because I want to give them the ""right"" answer. I've never found any of my therapists' advice actually helpful, and I've never been able to actually implement anything they suggest, but I don't know whether that's because the things they suggest don't work or because of a lack of trying. 

I want to make therapy work for me because it feels like the only option for me to get better and I'm really tired of what my mental health is doing to me and the people around me.

He sort of figured it out about himself through getting to know me and he confirmed my belief that I’m basically a walking advertisement for the disorder (it’s not just a belief; I know. I just don’t have a formal diagnosis because I’ve always purposefully sought out less-stigmatizing/more treatable diagnoses like depression, adhd, bipolar, etc.but I’ve never actually been myself with any therapist or doctor and I’ve been deemed “treatment resistant” for years and years and I also tend become cocky because I’m highly knowledgeable about psychiatry as a result of trying to fix myself since I was a teen). 

Anyway, as imagined, our relationship is very heated. The highs are way too high and lows are very low, especially for him. We actually met randomly through Reddit. I commented on a comment he made on a post in r/anhedonia (we’re both anhedonic depressives too, fun) regarding a medication. He responded back to my comment but I failed to follow up which is pretty typically “me” so he ended up sending me a DM in which he mentioned that we happen to live in the same city in a tiny random country. 

The only reason I even responded to his message was because it was interesting that we live in the same city since, as I said, we’re not in any “major” country so it was quite the coincidence. Even a coincidence he chose to randomly check out my Reddit history in the first place and saw where I was located. Neither one of us have photos of ourselves on Reddit or anything of the sort. 

We began chatting without even knowing each other’s ages. It was so far from anything other than totally platonic, conversations surrounding our shared suffering, what medications we’ve tried, advice, input, whatever. My memory is that of a small rodent’s so I genuinely don’t remember how or when things took a turn but they did and it was a sharp fucking turn. 

I’ll spare the details but a few months on now and he’s the only person I’ve ever beared my soul to in my life. Because there was no pressure to impress in the beginning and it was all about relating, I was extremely frank with him and vice versa. We became extremely invested in one another. By the time we saw how the other looked or sounded, we were basically already in love, the physical attraction just sealed the deal. 

That said, neither one of us in proper shape for a healthy relationship to exist. I’m beginning to go through a divorce and I have a 1.5-year-old son (the guy in question has a really lovely heart, he even seems to genuinely care about my son which most men would be scared off by surely) and he is contemplating suicide. In addition to mental health problems, he has an array of physical health concerns that are severely impacting his ability to live any semblance of a normal life. He doesn’t just have suicidal ideation, he’s crossed into the preparation zone and I’m the only person who knows about it. I believe him when he tells me that I’m the only thing creating any kind of light at the end of his tunnel. He’s extremely emotional and sensitive and we understand each other so well. I haven’t hid one ugly truth about myself where as I wear a full-on mask in every relationship in my life, romantic or otherwise. 

We’re at a point where we’re trying to see if it’s even a remote possibility to be together properly. Neither one of us want to be in another unhealthy relationship, we are super self-aware people (to a fault), we are frank about the obstacles that stand in front of us and we’ve both had our moments of wondering if we’re either individually or collectively too sick to form healthy relationships at this stage in our lives.

For context, the reason why I believe I may have BPD is due to the extreme trauma from my past relationship that is now triggered by the smallest things in my current relationship. My mom also struggles from BPD and I’m on birth control which may be a factor as well. 

I have a really low self esteem due to being cheated on in my past relationship and although my new partner is the complete opposite of what my ex was, I still have thoughts and worries that I’m not good enough. The most recent instance of this happening was when I wanted to surprise my partner with food without telling him, and I felt like he was blowing me off after he asked if it could wait until tomorrow. I know that he’s really busy because he’s also a student and works as well, but this led me to believe that he didn’t want to see me or that I’m not a priority to him. I then blew up on him and said hurtful things about him that he was vulnerable about and in the moment, I was angry and thought that me saying that would make me feel heard. 

It’s been three days now, we have barely spoken and I have been regretting my actions nonstop. My self esteem is at an all time low, as I feel like the worst person to exist after hurting my partner after they’ve done nothing wrong. I feel so guilty for letting my past relationship mess up my current one and I know that it’s completely my fault. I genuinely feel like I have no way to regulate my emotions whenever I get triggered by something. I also know that it’s really hard for people who don’t have an understanding of this behavior to be able to handle being on the receiving end. I have no idea what to do and I’m seriously considering dropping out because how badly it’s affecting my academics, and I’ve also been having suicidal thoughts and fears of never being able to overcome this. 

I’ve been researching solutions that are possible for me such as therapy but I have nowhere to start. My hometown is six hours away and I only visit whenever my quarter is finished. How can I get diagnosed and start a treatment? If it’s possible I want to try to start something as soon as possible before this affects my life more than it already has.

For anonymity and simplicity I’ll call them Joe and Sam. A couple years ago I met Joe right after a rough breakup. I wasn’t in a good place but I fell for him immediately. Fast forward a couple months of things going really well and being happier than I ever have been with another person, we end up having a miscommunication. I get defensive and he calls me crazy. I end things. He tries to talk to me for a few days but I ignore him, opting to go on a bender. In the aftermath I crash out. I realize what I’ve done. I try to reconcile with him but the damage is done. This breaks me. I try so hard to mend things and see him again just to talk but he won’t see me. I knew he was hesitant about getting close to me in case he got hurt but I made him feel like he was safe to let his guard down with me. I thought he was. I hated myself for letting him down and making him build his walls back up. 

It took me a long time to be ok with what happened, and along the way I told myself I would never make that mistake again. If I was lucky enough to love anyone the same way again I wouldn’t fuck things up. I wouldn’t push them away if I got my feelings hurt. Then last year I met Sam. I was guarded at first but I fell for him faster than I meant to. He was everything I wanted in a man. I loved just being in his presence. He would get a little jealous but honestly I liked it. It wasn’t controlling or overbearing it just made me feel wanted. So when I had a friend coming to visit (guy friend of over 10 years, have never been remotely interested him romantically) he ended up feeling insecure, which I understood but tried my best to let him know there was nothing to worry about and that I’d reassure him in any way he wanted or needed. We had made plans to have a nice intimate evening at his place the night my friend was coming into town. On that day, when I tried to confirm plans I didn’t hear anything from Sam. So of course I start drinking, freak out, remove and block him on everything and unblock him to tell him this was a shit way to end things but fine, whatever. He was hurt and confused when he got the message, obviously. This time I immediately regretted it and tried to smooth things over the next day. He seemed willing at first but just became more and more distant before we could actually talk about anything. And now it’s been two weeks since we’ve spoken. 

Ironically Joe is now messaging me but my feelings for him are so drowned out by both time to heal and my longing for Sam. I also ended up moving so it’s not like I could see him anyway. I’m somewhat comforted in knowing he didn’t just turn his feelings off for me and missed me while I was missing him. It makes me hopeful that Sam still misses me even while his guard is up against me. I feel bad that the timing didn’t work out and that we missed each other for so long while nothing came from it. I feel bad for hurting both of them by being unstable. I feel hopeless that I’ll ever be able to sustain a healthy relationship or ever love again. I always feel like I’ll never love again. But I know I won’t meet anyone like Sam. He made me happy in ways I didn’t think were possible. I’ve never felt someone’s touch as so calming and electric at the same time. Everything with him was unique and incredible. I miss him and I hate myself for ruining things with someone so amazing. 

I doubt anyone has read my whining and moaning this far, it ended up being a lot longer than I intended. I’m not looking for pity, I know I brought this upon myself. I don’t even need advice either because I know exactly how I fucked up lol. I wish in the moment I could remember that I’m overreacting and to take a moment before saying, doing or sending anything.

Fix me?
I took notes on how to have a healthy fp
Understand my attachment style
I’m just worried I’m missing something 

“

3/3

Boundaries with eachother 
Once a week have a designated routine time to talk about any big feelings you may have about the other but in a calm I want to find a solution way 
You made me feel like this because 
What can we both do better so this doesn’t happen again 
Work on my self esteem 
Regular check ins from both parties 
Take the time to learn both parties triggers and boundaries 
Learn about my attachment style and the others
Ask intentions
Ask if she is instead of I feel like she is
Stop jumping
Ask
Stop, breathe and give yourself the space you need 
Maintain comfort and hobbies that are just for me 
Socialize with others 
Identify my triggers 
Learn my boundaries 
Realistic expectations 
Validate myself 
Do not over rely on anyone to help you 
Practice saying no 
Seek outside support outside of my relationship 
Understand tone and not the tone you perceive 
Do not get lost on what you know to be true 
Understand someone else’s truth too 
you are not too much
You are not a monster 
Validate yourself 
Just because your brain did something faster does not make me a failure 
Learn to love yourself 
You are loveable
You are loved even when you don’t feel like it in the moment 
It’s just a moment
It’s temporary
This feeling , this bad fight , this distance , this agony because your brain and body is in fight mode is not forever 
This is not forever 
Find a calm place 
I’m in a battle but I can survive the war 
there is a reason behind why I do what I do
Even if I can’t find it in the moment 
Find it in the moment
Think about it 
Give yourself me time 
Learn to want to do things by yourself 
You don’t need to be on a call to Diamond art or read 
You may have delusional thoughts but you are not delusional 
fear and anxiety do not control you 
Your mental state does not define you 
If you feel like someone downplays your emotions express that instead of reacting and being triggered 
Do not spiral into that trigger
Regulate that trigger 
Not everything is your fault even if you think it is 
If your memory is messy your mental state is messy take note of it 
I miss you and it hurts but I know you did it for me 
I’m doing really good..
I almost got stuck like 4 times 
But I used my skills
Count colors 
Chew ice 
Those are comfort
Coffee is comfort and so is carbonated drinks 
Breathe through straw help if chest isn’t too heavy 
Blankets 
Smells
Burn a candle or wax sometimes
I know what helps I just need to think more 
I need to talk to Grace or idk
I think I have OCD and it’s bad
Unless it’s autism
Hangers have to be certain way
If my break change I get stressed out 
Me not being on register 4 almost sent me into a meltdown 
But I’m okay
But I’m noticing things 
I used to love mobile games before I was always on call 
Monopoly go
Bud farm 
The office clicker 
My favorites
Home
Tired
Want to play with Kit
Can’t 
..stuck..
..not real 
Not real
Not real
You are okay
she needs space not forever 
Space is healthy
Your plan was to find anyone to hangout with irl
Ur April and Shelby can’t 
I wish I could go back 
I wish I could go back
Niamh is not moms
Scarlett is not moms
Kit is not moms
Casket is not moms
No one is out to get me
No one wants to hurt me
No one is going to tell me my feelings are wrong UNLESS it is bpd brain
I want to be told in that way
If my feelings are wrong tell me it’s my bpd 
it made me look at it 
Why I felt that way and such 
I didn’t show her I can’t do it
I didn’t hit the nail
No
Stop focusing on words
You haven’t lost her no matter how loud the screams are
You feel she doesn’t want to hear from you 
Because of everything the last few days,  ? ,And Ok 
This is going to be my brain totally unfiltered if you haven’t seen 
I think 
Subconsciously I mask at work and that’s why I’m so exhausted and over it and overstimulated and overwhelmed 
Lights bother me 
Noise bothers me
Questions bother me 
Everything could set me off
How I get past this 
Fuck if I know 
But I identified a theory
You jump too easily to giving up
Self care and destress
That’s all you need to do 
That’s all you ever needed to do
You don’t love your body
I don’t know if I can fix that 
I need to work on my self esteem but that’s my biggest part. It’s my biggest part why I don’t think I deserve to be loved. It’s my biggest part.. 
fuck
I need to change 
I need
No
Calm 
You don’t expect me to be fixed you expect me to try 
It doesn’t feel like anyone cares about me because my phone has been completely dead all day
It doesn’t feel like anyone cares I disappeared
It hurt when she played overwatch with anyone else because she did call it our game
Just overwatch 
Now it’s Fall guys 
But I still can’t have that expectation 
I do want us to have just us games 
I like having things that are just us 
I can compromise with my brain 
Can’t expect her to not play a game with anyone else
But want a just us game 
Danganronpa is a game only her and I talk about it 
There 
There’s that validation
Danganronpa is a game only her and I talk about 
Danganronpa is a game only her and I talk about 
But even tho that is our game if she talks about it with someone else that doesn’t mean it isn’t ours anymore. 
3’s 
Taking note of that as well
I miss her voice
It’s okay to miss her 
But remember that feeling is not forever 
I need to regress.. 
That’s not healthy 
I feel pain 
I feel hurt
I feel too much 
It’s too much 
I made a mistake
I pushed Onyx away as self sabotage 
How do I get my brain to stop screaming mama 
I don’t want it to
I had a good day
Even with all these feelings
I had a good day
I’m trying ..
I’m literally lying to myself.. how is this how I fix me I don’t understand I don’t I’m 
Can’t
Help me..
No one can help me.. 
no one should help me 
Stuck
Stick
Stuck
Bite
Okay okay 
Ur okay
There you go
You just need to do that every time
No one is going to hurt you 
No one wants to hurt you 
No one wants to leave 
No one hates you 
No one hates you 
You are loved 
You don’t deserve to cry 
I don’t know how long this is going to take and that’s the scariest part
I just want to be better now
I just want to be better 
There’s nothing wrong with my body
I’m pretty
You think you can’t 
You can 
She won’t be gone forever 
I’m trying to stay positive 
I’m trying to remember what I have 
I miss my partners 
I miss my girls 
I miss my it and theys 
I miss my boys 
I miss them all 
You are allowed to have a voice 
You are allowed to be excited 
You are allowed to be you 
You are allowed to have feelings 
You are allowed to feel
You are allowed to not want to 
You are allowed to be not okay 
You are allowed to need 
I can’t have my person for now 
She’s not gonna replace me
She still loves me
All she’s ever done is love me
All she’s ever done is show me what I deserve 
I couldn’t believe it 
I didn’t let myself believe it
I can believe it
I will meet her one day
I’ll see her one day
You aren’t going against it in less than a few hours 
Keep to what you say
If you don’t think you can don’t make the promise or say you will , say you want to. 
Onyx is not mad at you 
Kit is not mad at you she is hurt 
She doesn’t blame me 
I took the crooked man off because I want to keep that to myself 
It’s my favorite 
It’s my hobby
I need to have my own things
My name is Emercy and that is okay
Change is okay
It’s scary but it’s not going to kill you 
I promise you will be okay
I love you 
She loves you too 
My attachment style is anxious preoccupied 
I crave closeness with a high fear of abandonment 
Affirmations of love 
I seek reassurance from you the most because you are the most I’m scared to lose and it makes perfect sense when I put it that way. 
Work on self esteem 
Create healthy boundaries 
May exhibit jealousy or possessiveness 
That really does sound like me huh?
I’m sorry I didn’t take the time to understand that
Self care and proper communication will help with this attachment style
Have patience with myself and with you 
I can validate myself but hearing positive thoughts you think about me sometimes helps 
The attention I get being inconsistent/ changing can make it hard to regulate 
I’m used to Wednesdays
That changing in anyway messes me up to the point I lash out on anybody 
I know why now 
I’m used to the 19th
That changes and my world stops functioning 
I understand now why. 
Treat my codependency 
Space is healthy
Self soothe is healthy 
Compliments help
Practice my mind full skills more 
Before I make a decision, react, or have an action think before I do it.
Focus on what’s going on with my head and body 
Practice asking for space when I need to
I was doing this 
I just got afraid and stopped 
I did this I was afraid she was upset at me for needing space 
I realize that is a unrealistic thought 
Limit how much you help others over yourself 
Communicate my feelings but in a healthy calm way
I also have a fear of being lied to, betrayed 
That’s from my attachment style
I understand I need to feel safe in my relationship not by something they do but by self validation 
Inconsistent communication is a trigger for my attachment 
The expectation of goodnight /good morning texts 
Not telling me plans when you usually do
Delayed communication when I’m used to you responding quickly may be taken as rejection 
Perceived rejection 
We knew this is a trigger
Didn’t know it’s also an attachment style trigger 
lack of reassurance is also a trigger 
Validation will help
Constant conflict and arguments make me feel like this may be the end of our relationship 
Comparing me to another past partner or current partner makes me question my self worth 
I also have to be careful 
Because I may also perceive comparisons when they aren’t there. “If I can do it you can” I hear Niamh saying that all the time in my head. 
I think also feeling like you were comparing what you could do to your brain and I wasn’t able to quickly messed with me too
Let me put that better 
I feel like when you told me you put in the work and stuff my brain perceived that as comparison and I was doing wrong.
partners who are emotionally unavailable are not for my attachment style at all. 
Situations where the relationship is undefined can make me feel like my relationship isn’t safe 
‘No label’ 
I think I’m understanding why that hurt me so bad when you or Niamh wanted it 
When the relationship is unclear I am unclear on what I am allowed and not allowed. I am unclear on if I am loved. The no label is the same as a lack of commitment in my brain. 
I crave connections with my partner 
It’s overwhelming when I don’t feel connected to my partner
balence between opening up and potential harm is hard 
Opening up may trigger fear of abandonment more 
Building trust with one another and connecting helps
Consistent feelings of trust and safety 
That’s a need
I have needs
I just have to find them. 
Focus on our moments of joy instead of fights
This will help regulate those unloved unwanted thoughts 
I loved when we watched Lucy together
I love sharing my favorite things with you 
But I do need my own things too 
Learning that balance 
I think finding some support group ish servers will benefit me 
Connecting with others who understand how I feel is another way of validation 
Self reflection needs to be done more”
If you read all of that.. thank you ",0,0,1741082766.0,"Advice? Can I have someone look at my notes on how to 
Idk
Fix me?
I took notes on how to have a healthy fp
Understand my attachment style
I’m just worried I’m missing something 

“

3/3

Boundaries with eachother 
Once a week have a designated routine time to talk about any big feelings you may have about the other but in a calm I want to find a solution way 
You made me feel like this because 
What can we both do better so this doesn’t happen again 
Work on my self esteem 
Regular check ins from both parties 
Take the time to learn both parties triggers and boundaries 
Learn about my attachment style and the others
Ask intentions
Ask if she is instead of I feel like she is
Stop jumping
Ask
Stop, breathe and give yourself the space you need 
Maintain comfort and hobbies that are just for me 
Socialize with others 
Identify my triggers 
Learn my boundaries 
Realistic expectations 
Validate myself 
Do not over rely on anyone to help you 
Practice saying no 
Seek outside support outside of my relationship 
Understand tone and not the tone you perceive 
Do not get lost on what you know to be true 
Understand someone else’s truth too 
you are not too much
You are not a monster 
Validate yourself 
Just because your brain did something faster does not make me a failure 
Learn to love yourself 
You are loveable
You are loved even when you don’t feel like it in the moment 
It’s just a moment
It’s temporary
This feeling , this bad fight , this distance , this agony because your brain and body is in fight mode is not forever 
This is not forever 
Find a calm place 
I’m in a battle but I can survive the war 
there is a reason behind why I do what I do
Even if I can’t find it in the moment 
Find it in the moment
Think about it 
Give yourself me time 
Learn to want to do things by yourself 
You don’t need to be on a call to Diamond art or read 
You may have delusional thoughts but you are not delusional 
fear and anxiety do not control you 
Your mental state does not define you 
If you feel like someone downplays your emotions express that instead of reacting and being triggered 
Do not spiral into that trigger
Regulate that trigger 
Not everything is your fault even if you think it is 
If your memory is messy your mental state is messy take note of it 
I miss you and it hurts but I know you did it for me 
I’m doing really good..

It was eye opening but it's still a curse within itself, now i know that my feelings aren't all real and my rage isn't always justified as i thought. I took meds, respidrone and paroxetine for 2 years (one year prior to my therapist actually telling me what's wrong with me lol ik it's a weird policy but wtv) my therapist wasn't a good person and now i am no longer with them. Meds helped with the thoughts, anger, suicidal tendencies and my spiritual psychosis. But i always felt dead more than anything. I wasn't myself i was empty not capable to love, now i am 7 months off all drugs, and years alchohol/THC sober. I am alive and i am happy except that i am not. I am tired of thinking that the ppl that loves me ridicule me. I am sick of feeling that the person next to me in a public transportation is thinking that i am stupid and that they will attack me. I am tired of meditation so i can see the bigger picture. I am tired of splitting on my family, my friends and even the God whom i worship and love. I can't recognize myself in the mirror.

1j2zjfp,BPD,My cat,"CW: SI/SH

My cat came to me last month in such a weird way. I was thoroughly in the pit of hopeless despair bawling my eyes out in my room as usual when my friend texted me, high, with a Facebook post of a seemingly abused/neglected cat who would be released if not claimed.

1j2khk3,BPD,How to deal with abandonment in romantic relationships?,"TW: suicide 

How does everyone deal with the bad feelings that come with romantic relationships?

I’m 19F, diagnosed with BPD over a year ago and currently I have been in remission for the past 4 months or so.

“Remission” for me means:
- no self harm
- no suicidal ideation or attempts
- minimal and infrequent mood swings 
- no impulsive behaviour
- stable relationships 

Right before I started to be in remission, I went through a major breakup which caused me to spiral and attempt suicide. I spent some time in a mental hospital. Since then I have been single and doing very well. 

I’m now getting to know someone and we have been on 1 date, so it’s very early days. I like them and they are looking for a relationship.

But I’ve noticed some of my old symptoms are coming back. I’m anxious about them leaving me, I get angry if they haven’t replied to my texts, I’m paranoid about them meeting someone better, and I’m sad because they haven’t arranged a second date yet (even though they’d like to see me again).

I REALLY don’t want this to get out of hand, and I can’t afford to have a huge breakdown over this because it wrecked my whole life last time. I’m finally stable and I want to keep things this way, but I don’t know how to get a handle on the feelings of abandonment. 

I feel physically sick with pain and constantly anxious they will leave me. My behaviour has been completely normal and fine, and they haven’t noticed anything (they don’t even know I have BPD yet). So I’m acting completely chill and calm but inside there’s a storm of feelings.

How do I expend all this energy??? I’ve been running almost every day (best coping mechanism) but I’m injured right now so just at home and my mind is going crazy.

All my other symptoms have disappeared, but I get so anxious in relationships. I would love any advice at all.

TL;DR: I am symptom-free, but now I’m dating someone and my thoughts/feelings are anxious and upset. How to get rid of them? ",1,0,1741013869.0,"How to deal with abandonment in romantic relationships? TW: suicide

Hey y'all. My question is exactly what it says in the title. My best friend recently found out that his ex and fp now has a girlfriend, and he's not taking it well at all. He says he's been struggling deeply with suicidal thoughts because of it. He's telling himself that he can't go on without him, and that if he doesn't find another partner for himself soon, he's going to end it, which he has attempted before

This isn't the first time this has happened with an fp, and while I've been by his side during those times, I've never really been sure how to help. I've tried asking him directly, but he usually says he feels to numb and disoriented to know what kind of help he needs, which makes sense from his perspective

I thought I'd ask other people with bpd how I can help support him while he works towards moving on from his fp. Obviously not every solution works for every person, but I would at least like to know the different approaches I can take to see what works best for him. Like I said, I've definitely been by his side when this has happened before, but I feel like I'm not doing all that I could to help bring him back on his feet.

I was confused because I thought I didn’t have a particularly traumatic upbringing. I was raised by a single- no siblings, just me and her. I thought everything was normal.

 That is until recently when I finally accepted that my mother was deeply mentally ill, likely suffering a severe form of BPD herself. I was just a kid. I thought all her reactions to things were how all normal people react to stuff. I thought it was all normal. She suffered delusional and paranoid thoughts that I just accepted as fact because I was a child. I thought meltdowns when met with anything even slightly stressful was normal. I lived in a constant state of anxiety in fear of triggering a meltdown or being yelled at for the silliest things. That state of constant anxiety was hell. I began suffering from suicidal and self-harm thoughts at the age of 11. These persisted throughout my teen years including my first suicide attempt at 15 or 16. I was in and out of therapy. What I didn’t realize was happening behind the other side of the door was discussions with my mom about where this was coming from and blaming her to which she would get extremely defensive and meltdown. I thought it was ridiculous to blame her since she loved me. I thought it was my fault and I was just broken.

I have a long history of relationship failures- all of which ended in my partners mental break down due to my behaviors.

I have a severe fear of abandonment and being alone. I’ve been married almost 9 years now but currently separated with my husband unwilling to reconcile until I’m cured- citing specifically my codependency, and tendency for spiraling. I’ve been in and out of therapy for years which never helped and I think it’s because I didn’t understand the root cause: my mother.

1j74i1t,depression_help,Trying to Save My Relationship,"I, 36F, lost my mother suddenly last month. My dad hasn’t loved her in all my memory and my brother largely copied my dad’s behavior towards her and would make a lot of jokes at her expense and never really spend time with her. 

I spent all the time. Especially after my sister commit suicide ten years ago. 

On top of this, my mom handled *everything* in the household. Every bill. All the paperwork. The shopping. Etc. and left my dad in a huge lurch. This guy can’t even adjust the volume on a Nokia flip phone he’s had for longer than 12 years by now. 

The pressure is tremendous — nearly all the time off I’ve had since she died (my work doesn’t offer any time of bereavement time so I used up all my PTO right after she died from grief and funeral planning) — is dedicated toward helping my dad. There is no phone call or bill or paperwork he feels confident enough to handle himself. And he relies on me more than my brother, 42M, because he finds me more competent. 

Onto of that, due to an error my brother made in my taxes 9 years ago, despite attempts to send in amended returns — I owe the government $45k. And trying to get all my ducks in a line to do an offer in compromise is killing me. 

I moved out the day after my mother died for the first time in my life because I’m a fucking loser and shit’s expensive and I don’t have a good enough job that could cover an apartment and a car payment by myself simultaneously. It wasn’t planned that way, it was just the move in date. And my dad told me if I let her death keep me from moving out he’d be very upset with me. 

I say all that to say I am… drowning. And fighting tooth and nail to stay above it. To laugh sometimes. I am *trying*. 

I am trying to enjoy having a place for the first time. But I can’t. I have no time to go out and get the cute things we need for the place to make it fun. 

But my partner is a happy go lucky guy. He forgets things pretty easily like a goldfish but he wants to help. He has wanted to help and fix me for years. And I hate that he can’t. I wish he could. But my depression is a bigger monster than him.

I go to therapy once a week. 

But I want to go away. Not die, just not exist. I am so tired of hurting people because I’m breathing. I hate myself so fucking much. 

I’m so unbelievably stressed out and I hate that he’s suffering so much. 

I offered to stay with my dad to give him space from me and the blackness I’m in. 

But he doesn’t want that. 

But being near me is hurting him so much. ",2,1,1741514556.0,"Trying to Save My Relationship I, 36F, lost my mother suddenly last month. My dad hasn’t loved her in all my memory and my brother largely copied my dad’s behavior towards her and would make a lot of jokes at her expense and never really spend time with her. 

I spent all the time. Especially after my sister commit suicide ten years ago. 

On top of this, my mom handled *everything* in the household. Every bill. All the paperwork. The shopping. Etc. and left my dad in a huge lurch. This guy can’t even adjust the volume on a Nokia flip phone he’s had for longer than 12 years by now. 

The pressure is tremendous — nearly all the time off I’ve had since she died (my work doesn’t offer any time of bereavement time so I used up all my PTO right after she died from grief and funeral planning) — is dedicated toward helping my dad. There is no phone call or bill or paperwork he feels confident enough to handle himself. And he relies on me more than my brother, 42M, because he finds me more competent. 

Onto of that, due to an error my brother made in my taxes 9 years ago, despite attempts to send in amended returns — I owe the government $45k. And trying to get all my ducks in a line to do an offer in compromise is killing me. 

I moved out the day after my mother died for the first time in my life because I’m a fucking loser and shit’s expensive and I don’t have a good enough job that could cover an apartment and a car payment by myself simultaneously. It wasn’t planned that way, it was just the move in date. And my dad told me if I let her death keep me from moving out he’d be very upset with me. 

I say all that to say I am… drowning. And fighting tooth and nail to stay above it. To laugh sometimes. I am *trying*. 

I am trying to enjoy having a place for the first time. But I can’t. I have no time to go out and get the cute things we need for the place to make it fun. 

But my partner is a happy go lucky guy. He forgets things pretty easily like a goldfish but he wants to help. He has wanted to help and fix me for years. And I hate that he can’t. I wish he could. But my depression is a bigger monster than him.

My dad found out, he came into my room not angry but scared with tears streaming down his face he used the flesh parts of his hand to hit my door as loud as he could to frighten me and then told me to never ever do that. 

At 11 years old, I was told to never go into my dads room, I always stayed out. One day the door was slightly open so I closed it and accidentally opened the door doing so to see blood everywhere, on the carpet, on his bed, on his desk. I stood there for what I thought was hours assessing his room frozen still because I didn’t expect this. My dad was always a force, a protector, a provider, I never knew he would do this to himself. I kept quiet though. It wasn’t my place to ask, then one day at the theatres my dad with a long sleeved T-shirt on finally showed me his self harm. 

At 12, I was trying to find myself after my dad succeeded with his attempt, going over and over in my head with what I could have done differently to help. How I could have made him stay. 

At 13 couldn’t wait to get home from school so I could feel my pain through self harm, my thoughts and feelings were projected on my body, I felt that I needed it. I stopped going to school. I never got out of bed. My room started to pile and pile with plates and bags.

At 14 it had been a very rough month where I was non stop thinking about ending my life. Every second, every minute they were thoughts and I gave in to my thoughts and attempted. My dad this time wasn’t there to help in his own little ways.

At 15 I failed all of my exams, I didn’t know what I was going to do with my future. 

At 16 I was accepted into a college where I learnt how to communicate and befriend other people and learn new things, I still struggled with my mental health but it was getting better and better slowly.

At 17 I still have bad days, but I can confidently say that it does get better. 

I am doing a course in college that I love and I will be doing a first years bachelor diploma next year.

1j59y01,depression_help,My partner and I are holding eachother hostage.,"I am omitting genders for privacy reasons and unbiased responses.

I am 24, they are 29.

Let's call them ""M"". 

I can not imagine living in a world without them. ""M"" knows this. And it's painful for both of us.

We are in a long distance relationship of 3 years. I live in the US and they are in Mexico. I have visited and plan to visit again soon. We want to get married and move in together.

They're an incredibly brilliant mind but life has not been kind at all.

'M' has no support group and family is 0 help. M has no job and lives with parents who contribute to the problem.

The source of M's suffering is joblessness. Despite having a good degree in applied science, the job market in Mexico is absolute shit. M has been out of a job for several years and with each passing day, M gets more depressed. 

They describe the feeling as ""running out of time"",  ""wasting my life"", ""I don't know what to do with my life"". The main issue is that they never even got a chance in the first place. M's connections from college and work within the University has done very little for career advancement. 

Not to mention that M has Aspergers and is not the best socially. 

So, M has been basically bedrotting for a long time. Applying for jobs constantly, being incredibly overqualified and receiving barely any response. A good amount of interviews for sales and fast food but no calls back. They did get one job in sales but didn't meet the sales quota and got fired.

The whole time we have been together, there has been an aura of dread and sadness.

They have been sad every day of our relationship. Some days less than others. And I can't do anything about it. 

When we met, M was fresh out of a very bad situation with someone abusive. M was incredibly suicidal. M has been incredibly suicidal since long before we met. Since childhood.

And I have been just barely enough support and love and hope to stop them from doing it. 

I will never admit it but this is indeed hurting me. I have my own issues and recently they are coming up from inside of me and growing. Still, my problems are not nearly as important. 

I don't know what to do. I am scared to death every day but try to keep a happy face. I am so sad and depressed. And I know I shouldn't stay because it's hurting me but I will not leave. I will never leave. There's a very real risk of suicide if I withdraw. And I don't know what I would do if it happened. I don't know if I would even know if it did.

Recently, it's gotten worse. We are working through relationship issues that are incredibly complicated. (M had feelings for a coworker from before getting fired, extreme guilt, etc.) It's better now. This, however, started a downward spiral for them and their condition is critical. I am currently paying for weekly therapy appointments but I fear it's not enough. 

All I know is that M wants to die, and selfishly, I stand in the way.

I met my soulmate when we met. Believe me when I tell you that we are perfect. Our minds complement eachother perfectly. Yes, I had to rethink things after the relationship issue we had. I'm still coming to terms with it. That's a big part of this. Still, I never doubt that I love them.

I would give anything to have them stay on Earth.

I just need help or a lead or anything to help me pull us out of this. Anything to help avoid something terrible happening for the time being. It's so hard to help from far away. 

This is a cry for help. I don't know what do to.",3,3,1741305195.0,"My partner and I are holding eachother hostage. I am omitting genders for privacy reasons and unbiased responses.

I am currently paying for weekly therapy appointments but I fear it's not enough. 

All I know is that M wants to die, and selfishly, I stand in the way.

I met my soulmate when we met. Believe me when I tell you that we are perfect. Our minds complement eachother perfectly. Yes, I had to rethink things after the relationship issue we had. I'm still coming to terms with it. That's a big part of this. Still, I never doubt that I love them.

I would give anything to have them stay on Earth.

I just need help or a lead or anything to help me pull us out of this. Anything to help avoid something terrible happening for the time being. It's so hard to help from far away. 

This is a cry for help. I don't know what do to.",1.5892241682531294,0.5533957316450658,Negative,High-Risk
1j59o5m,depression_help,The possibility of a third world war (and not just that) is destroying my life.,"I’m 20 years old (M) and I feel like I’ve wasted too much time and opportunities, and now I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m scared of the future, especially the possibility of a world war, and this has taken away all my motivation to build something for the long term. I’m studying medicine, which is my dream, but I wonder if it makes sense to continue if everything could collapse in a few years.

Because of this, I’m starting to question whether it makes sense to invest years of my life in something so demanding or if I should instead focus on more immediate goals. I feel like giving up everything and dedicating myself to “easier” and more attainable things, like getting a Mazda MX-5, going out, having fun, and living in the present without worrying too much about the future. Basically, I don’t know whether to keep pursuing long-term dreams or enjoy life while I can.

This dilemma is wearing me down every. single. day.
This confusion prevents me from making decisions and I feel predominantly sad and stuck. I can’t enjoy any moment, whether good or bad.

On a personal level, I’ve never had a girlfriend. I don’t consider myself ugly. However, I lack self-esteem, both physically and socially. I feel insecure and don’t know how to behave romantically with girls, which makes me feel somewhat inferior to others.

I feel stuck between fear of the future, low self-confidence, and indecision about what the right thing to do is.

Do you have any advice? I’m going crazy.

1j4nsef,depression_help,repost due to char limit.,"Hello, sorry in advance for long read.

my earliest memory I posses is me, Year 6, which is 12 years of age where I live. In this memory I distinctively remember looking out the window, staring and I suppose zoning out, when I just suddenly started crying for no discernible reason.  
I don't remember majority of my childhood, but I know that since that moment felt like the starting point in my life, like I ""woke up"".

I've currently graduated secondary school and am 19 years of age as of writing this, all I know for sure is that, I enjoyed high-school, I was mostly left alone, couple minor incidents here and there but that's life. I remember all throughout high-school though, just a feeling of deep emptiness in my gut and a constant overwhelming sadness, by age 17, I had already attempted to take my life twice, I had dropped all of my former commitments, such as out of school sporting. Despite all this, I've been described to have a great sense of commitment, so I persevered, I was able to find fleeting happiness in things, but even when happy I felt hopeless, I was constantly fatigued no matter how much / how little I slept, never really been one to eat a healthy amount at any point in my life.

Something strange happened for a week that I figured I should mention. >!In my free time, when I have the social battery, I usually just hang out with this one mate and we walk around the city. This period of 8ish days in November of 2024, I slept horribly, which is saying something because my sleep is typically notoriously bad, I was sleeping 2h\~ a night, yet woke up feeling energized, not once did I feel fatigued , and I also had this insane energy of just excited-ness and hyper, my thoughts during these days were racing more so than usual, me and my friend were roaming the city for 8 days straight and I had spent $600 of my savings on stupid stuff I regret buying, has this happened to anybody else or am I overthinking this?!<

After I felt I was slightly more sorted, I tried MDMA as I've heard of it's capabilities if used responsibly, on the 26th-12-24, I had my first dose of MDMA, half of my bodyweight, and what I experienced was nothing short of world changing, I won't go into details but it shifted my perspective a great deal.

For the first time in my memory, I had felt genuine happiness and my head had quieted down, a stark contrast to the constant racing thoughts, suicidal at most times. Since this (3 months ago) I have yet to experience a thought of self harming, and am able to find the beauty in small things. I was also so able to focus and concentrate which was an insane capability compared to my normal self.

I'm seeing a psychiatrist, and I had previously been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder & Chronic Suicidal Ideation, I had taken SSRI's before any of the MDMA stuff, and they just made me feel like a zombie. I had told him about that week in November, and he suggests I may be Bipolar?

I suppose I'm just looking for conversation / support

1j4570w,depression_help,Hello everyone,"# Hey everyone,

I’m from Hungary, and English isn’t my first language, so sorry for any mistakes.

I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was 14. That’s when everything started to change for me. I want to share my story because I feel like I’ve been carrying this burden alone for too long, and I just want to see if anyone else has been through something similar.

When I started middle school, I had to go to a camp before classes began. It was supposed to be a fun way to meet new classmates, but for me, it was the opposite. I felt completely alone. I couldn’t make any friends, and at night, I cried in my bed, not wanting to talk to anyone. I even stayed awake just to avoid socializing.

The worst moment was when, at the end of the camp, everyone signed each other’s white shirts as a memory. When I looked at mine, I saw it was completely empty. Nobody had written anything. It might sound small, but for me, it was devastating. I realized then that I didn’t belong there. I left that school before I even started.

Since then, I’ve been struggling with social anxiety. I switched schools again and again, hoping it would get better, but it never did. I was always the quiet, anxious kid who couldn’t connect with anyone. I started therapy when I was 15 or 16, but nothing really changed.

I have never been in a relationship. In elementary school, I used to be popular, confident, and social. But suddenly, everything changed. No one ever showed interest in me, and whenever I tried, my fear and lack of confidence ruined everything. Girls lost interest before anything could even start.

I managed to graduate despite all the struggles, but those four years felt like the worst of my life. To cope, I started using snus, drinking energy drinks excessively, and eventually, I turned to weed. I even experimented with MDMA and other things just to feel something different—just to be happy for a little while.

After school, I started working at an airport. In some ways, it became my comfort zone, even though the job was stressful. But my anxiety never left me. I became addicted to snus and weed—they were my only relief after each exhausting day.

I’ve been dealing with these feelings for eight years now. I tried everything—therapy, medication, antidepressants. First, I got one for regular depression, but it didn’t work. Then I was diagnosed with bipolar depression and given another medication. I’ve been on it ever since, but I don’t feel like it’s helping. I also take medication for anxiety, which works temporarily, but I don’t want to become dependent on it.

I’ve had suicidal thoughts many times. I feel like I’ve completely lost myself. I don’t know who I am anymore. Every day feels harder than the last, and I’m scared that one day, these thoughts will win.

I’m not writing this to ask for sympathy. I just want to know if anyone else has been through something similar. Have you ever felt this lost? Have you ever felt like nothing helps?

I feel completely alone. I’ve never had close friends. Maybe it’s my fault, maybe it’s not. But I don’t know how to keep going anymore.

If you’ve read this far, thank you. And if you’re struggling too, I truly hope you find a way forward. Maybe our destiny is brighter than we think.",5,3,1741187352.0,"Hello everyone # Hey everyone,

I feel so unloved, neglected, tired, I don't see the point in anything right now. I'm tired. I just want to feel any sense of joy. I've been thinking for a few years that I might have bpd of some kind, or cptsd, I'm not sure.

1iz8opq,depression_help,Tired of this feeling.,"I wasn't sure what flair to add to this, but maybe if I get a suggestion that fits, I'll change it to fit. 
I've been struggling with the feeling like I should not exist for longer than I have words to describe. 
My first memory of self harm was when I was 5 years old and learned that living things bled and needed blood to live. I thought that if I could make my blood leak on purpose, I could cause myself to cease to exist. There's a bit more to it than that, and that's obvious to me as an adult, but as a child, that was the only way I could depict what I felt. 
The feeling hasn't changed, just evolved. I still find myself wishing to not exist, even after getting out of an abusive life and family, finding a supportive family and a husband who loves me, as well as going through therapy. 
I still find myself not wanting to exist. 
It makes me feel weak to even have these thoughts, but no matter how hard I try, I cannot seem to shake the feeling that I never should have been here to begin with. 
I've tried to trace these feelings back so many times, and I definitely have plenty of examples that I can remember from 6+years old, but they never seem to feel like the real cause of my self loathing. I've traced a lot of the behaviors and thought patterns back to pieces of my life with my therapist to make it all make sense, and most of it has made sense, ie; my mother told me things out of my control were my fault, so I blamed myself for everything that went wrong around me, even when it had nothing to do with me. 
Even after making these connections and forgiving myself for things that were never my fault, little things still kill me. 
I have two teenage stepsons and a daughter of my own blood, and they are the absolute light of my being, yet if I do something that upsets them, it sets with me for days, weeks, months, and I find it hard to forgive myself to the smallest things. My husband loves me and has done everything to prove his love to me, but the moment I do anything that might cross him (irritate him slightly or even just annoy him,) it's like a devastating hit to my conscious and I find myself contemplating my existence, wondering if they would have had a better life having never known me.
I know these are sick thoughts, and I hate myself just for having them, but no matter how hard I have tried to break out of this feeling that I am the scum of the earth, I still find myself wanting to die over the smallest errors. 

I don't know. I don't really want help or support, I just needed to put words to these feelings on a platform other than just my notes. I have tried to do journal entries like these, thinking I could grow if I could just understand these feelings, but I always end up hating myself more when I read back to reflect, even after the feelings of self loathing have passed for the moment. 
I just want to stop hating myself and I don't know how. I'm so tired of not being able to be happy with myself. I know I should like myself. I'm not a bad person, and I have only ever done what I thought was good or right, yet I still feel wrong for being alive.

1iz8hcp,depression_help,Am I exaggerating by choosing to see a psychiatrist?,"Hi everyone,
F28. Since my teenage years, I have always had issues with anxiety and mostly with some sort of ""depressive"" espisodes which can last from 1 day to 3-4 days. I've also had episodes of cutting my wrists and going from unbearable pain to apathy, then the next day I would feel very productive and optimistic. I reached a point where I could no longer stand this situation and I've started therapy around 8 years ago. My therapist has helped me out greatly and old trauma related to sexual abuse by a famiily member resurfaced. That explained a lot about my behaviour and feelings. At the time my therapist said that I was in a very light spectrum of bipolar disorder but that it was all connected to trauma and that throughout time and therapy I could get over that.
Therapy has generally improved my life in a great way and there were times when living felt really nice, but I have never stopped experiencing those ""black vortexes"" from time to time. They would really let me knocked out for a few days but eventually always managed to get up and start again, even though it always took a draining amount of energy and willpower.
Last month my partner of 5 years and long term projects broke up with me, and since then my life has gotten off the rail. I think that this has triggered something really deep inside of me and for the first time I am feeling deeply exhausted. I no longer have the will to live and the main reason is that I simply don't want to live life, because I cannot take anymore the rollercoaster that is to live. I simply cannot bear the extension of my emotions and I've been thinking about dying, even though I'm too much of a coward to actually attempt suicide. I've restarted cutting after many years and also reduced my food intake to quite a dangerous level (first time that this happens).
For the first time ever my therapist said I might need psychiatric help and made me book an appointment.
The thing is now I don't feel as desperate as I was a few days ago, I'm thinking that I might have faked it all and now that I'm feeling quite productive and ""stable"" again I'm convincing myself that I'm probably exaggerating it all and that this too shall pass. The suicidal thoughts haven't completely disappeared, they are in the background of my mind telling me that if things get too painful again there is always this other way out.
I'm very confused about the moment I'm going through and what is real and what isn't.

I have supportive friends and family around me, but as far as I know none of them has gone through something like this and it's very hard to relate to their comforting words. 
I would like to get a feedback or just a comment from someone who really gets what I'm saying (if they exist) and share your honest thoughts.

1ixj4a5,depression_help,I don't know how to deal with suicidal ideation and the lack of motivation to keep on living,"I'm 26 (M) and struggle to find meaning in life, ever since I was a kid I've always had a depressive personality and had to deal with the constant feeling of being isolated on the way I felt because people around me seemed to go trough the same or even have it worse in life but somehow still manage to find joy and enjoyment out of it.

  
I genuinely look at the people around me, such as co-workers, family or friends and rarely feel any connection with them and can't seem to share the ability to have dreams and work hard for my life because of how absurd everything appears to me and the extreme apathy and lack of motivation I experience towards life.

Living has always felt like it's just a non-stop pile of unpleasant, meaningless tasks (wake up, eat, go to work, stay healthy, maintain your life from falling apart and everything that goes in between every day, every year until you get rewarded with the relief of death on a hospital bed after years of struggle and pain from being old and sick).

  
I don't understand how one is supposed to have the courage to wake up everyday, work a job you hate, being in front of a desk all day and come back home to do some more of that while seeing your hope of a different world getting smaller everyday.

I have no hope for the world getting better sometimes I see the news and everything seems so horrifiying like humanity is doomed for real and feel extremely pessimistic about the future and like I'm never going to be able to cope with the world around me.

Nothing appears to attract me about the concept of being alive anymore I've tried to bound myself to the world by wanting to find love, appreciating friendship, religion, developing a strong interest or hobbies but absolutely nothing works anymore and it's getting worse to the point where everyday I think about dead, constanly fantasize about it and I even have a couple of methods I would like to try.

I've somehow ended up becoming dissapointed and lost hope on every single aspect of the things that were at some point even a little motivating to me.

  
I had my first 5 years relationship ending and the person that was the most precious to me doesn't even want to talk anymore then I'm also not very brilliant and I don't think I'll ever have the intelligence and patience to work my way to a succesfull career and feel trap on my dead end call center job feeling like I'm going to do jobs like this for the rest of my life.

  
I know there is people who have it WAY worse and can't stop feeling selfish and stupid for not knowing how to deal with everything and have a happy life.

So often I feel relief at the idea of ending it all and only weed and antidepressants had made me feel any different but after a while reality hits again and is even worse than before so I dont really want to rely on addiction as I way to cope.

I only keep myself here because of how bad it would be for my relatives to go through my death and also because I'm so scared of pain but when things get rough it always feels like I'm getting closer to really doing it this time and I burst into tears thinking it will never get better.

1iwwn17,depression_help,This world is killing me,"Hi!
I’m a 22 year old college student and my life has, after a short period of feeling “ok”, completely started to spiral downwards again.

I’ve had phases where my depression, social anxiety, paranoid thoughts, fear of abandonment and general mental health were already quite low, but now it’s at at the lowest point ever…

I haven’t had any human contact in 2 weeks, I only get up to do selfharm or to eat something every third day. I’ve somehow managed to get into a relationship but because of my extreme attachment issues and jealousy I ruined it completely. I have a lot of dangerous and paranoid thoughts that induce nightmares, keep me from sleeping and get me to do very bad things to myself. I’m failing Uni, cut contact to my parents and only leave the house to get fast food or buy new razors. Sometimes I just wonder if life is just a big game that wants to test how long you can stay alive before you commit suicide. I’m a broken person. I cry when I see myself in the mirror, I can’t communicate with people (I can’t even say hello to the cashier in the supermarket), I sometimes spend some nights in some sort of half awake - half asleep state where I can’t decide what is dream and what is reality anymore while doing selfharm, I’ve had suicidal thoughts a lot but I’m lacking the “motivation” to finally end all of this. In seconds I go from doing selfharm and wanting to end my life, having paranoid thoughts and thinking about being followed or hunted down to “happily” giggling while watching stupid TikTok videos…

I will never fit in, and to be honest? I don’t even want to fit into this society. The void and chaos I can feel in my chest everyday will never truly be gone. It will consume me one day.

I feel like my fears, emotional outbreaks and anxieties are completely out of control.
I often compare them to a monster sitting behind me, sitting in the dark with glowing eyes and huge teeth waiting to finally kill me. But when I turn around there’s nothing, just the void staring back at me.

Thanks for reading all of this nonsense.

I'd love to talk to a psychiatrist, but I can't afford it.  Living in this fast-paced world feels overwhelming and impossible.  I'm stuck in a cycle of negativity, and I don't know how to break free.  Any advice or resources would be greatly appreciated.

Hi, im 17F and english isnt my first language so sorry in advance for any mistakes. I think I genuinely destroyed the little life I had left

I've had depression for half my life and suicidal thoughts since forever, but last year in particular was worse than ever. To give a little context, I always had mental issues and I grew up in a somewhat dysfunctional family where almost everyone around me had BPD.

at the beginning of 2024 I lost all my friends because I changed schools and started working, some still checked on me from time to time but I lost all the affection I had for them after realizing the lack of interest they had for me, I also had acne for the first time in my life (I am extremely obsessive about my appearance) which led me to have extreme anxiety when interacting with other people and being in public, so I ended up socially isolating myself. 
Results: i stopped going to school and lost the year, and if I wanted to graduate I would have to do the entire school year from scratch and I would only get my diploma at 19 and a half years old. So I dropped out of school, the school year started approximately 2 months ago and I'm not enrolled and probably won't be. My parents don't care much about my education, they are pretty old already and stopped giving me direction in life a long time ago They didn't say anything when I lost the year or when I dropped out of school, they didn't say anything at all, but i guess they just lost the little hope they had for me.

I have no desire to go to college, or any interest in any course or profession, and to be honest I've always been like that, my parents never really made me think about my future, They kind of always just let me loose

The only thing I ever genuinely thought about being was a flight attendant, I'm conventionally attractive, people always said I have an elegant appearance, I would like to travel and live an eventful life, I'm great with languages ​​and until then I was pretty good at communicating

I don't know how I would graduate high school, the days go pass and I become more certain that I wouldn't be able to return and graduate late for a million reasons, there is the option of taking tests and graduating another way ig, but I have dyscalculia which makes everything 100 times more difficult.

After the disappointments I had with friendships last year I no longer have anyone by my side, and I don't really think Im able anymore to build new relationships. I don't have anyone that I love in my life.

The only escape for me would be to move to another city (I live in a very small city) but that would be impossible without the help of my family, and i dont think they want to help anymore 

So I think I'm just going to spend a few years lying in bed, watching life go by, just like my sister did

Ive contemplated ending it a couple of times ive just been unable to go through with it ….my parents on the other hand are always asking me to send money home (black tax) honestly i dont know what to do anymore

1iukuz8,depression_help,What do I do with my life?,"
This is just a little yap session. I am a M(14) and my life has been super mundane and at some points down right awful. Life has just been boring to me lately, I haven’t been doing my homework cause I haven’t felt like it, I sleep too much, and I just sit and think about life and random things. I know what I want to do with my life, but I just don’t know if I can get a good head start to ensure my victories. Living in California in a lower middle-class household isn’t the best and at times I feel as if I’m missing out on luxuries all my friends have like newest phones, AirPods, there own rooms for Christs sake. Not to mention but my room and life is a mess and has been. My parents have separate rooms which causes me to not be able to have my own room, so I live in a room that was added to the backyard after the house was made so the room doesn’t have proper air conditioning and it has too many windows. My door is also glass so I have no privacy. Also my school just sucks tbh, I dislike the such rude people in it. Everyone makes fun of special education kids, people who are disabled, etc etc, and it just hurts me to watch, it makes me sort of mad. I dislike this feeling but it’s a normal feeling to feel against dicks. Also I don’t really fit in anywhere in most of my classes. I’m just kinda there. I mean I have a girlfriend at least but since how I am I can barely talk to her in person without almost having a panic attack. I cannot maintain eye contact with anyone without profusely sweating and shaking. It also doesn’t help that I don’t play sports and I’m not in any clubs; I’m in my choir at least but I still don’t feel like I fit in, mostly due to the fact it’s either filled with extremely nerdy people or super Christians with huge egos who always have to sing the best cause they know they’re the best. I’m also not very good at anything in person like hobbies, I don’t play any instruments mostly because of income. The stuff I’m best at is almost useless, just European countries and psychology. I don’t want to do anything with either yet I’m proficient in them. I’m always a therapist for my friends and I’m constantly having to help them. I want something in return but they just wouldn’t understand my numbness. This numbness has been happening for about a year or two, middle school was terrible and I cried countless amounts of time. I don’t have suicidal thoughts or anything, I’m on antidepressants, yet I just feel so numb and bored of everything. I can’t listen to music anymore without constantly skipping through songs, I can’t play any games for longer than 30 minutes anymore, and I’m glued to instagram or tik tok. I’m also not very attractive so my self image is usually low, but then again I really don’t care abt that anymore, I have no need too.

I’m 17, male, and I want to go into Early Childhood Education. Preferably Head Start or something along those lines since I’m very empathetic and like helping struggling kids. I come from a broken family due to a lot of bad decisions my mom made that I don’t feel like going into but that info is necessary for context. 

At the beginning of the school year I got a job working in After School care at a local elementary school and absolutely fell in love with the job. Pay wasn’t great but the kids there were an absolute dream to work with. I seriously treated them like my family at times. 

And there was this one kid in particular who I grew really fond of because he looked and acted just like a miniature me and it was clear he was facing similar family issues at home that I faced when I was his age. So I took it upon myself to make him as happy as I could so he’d hopefully have a better childhood. I admit this made me cater to him a bit more than the rest, but I talked to my director about it and I was actively trying to minimize the excessive catering. 

And then in early December I found out my younger brother went to the local school, so before after school care started I tried to go to his class and say hi. His teacher stopped me though because she was unsure if I was allowed to, which I respected and forgot about it. Well about a month ago the school district found out and forced me to get fired. Sending me into a severe depression. 

I am absolutely devastated to have lost contact with all of the kids there, I loved each and every one of them. But I’m especially upset about losing contact with mini me. I feel like I failed him. Like I should still be there to guide him through his family issues but I can’t. And even though I know he’ll have other supportive people in his life, a selfish part of me wants to be the only one, like I don’t trust anyone else to help him. Granted I do have his moms number, and I did explain what happened to her and offered to babysit him if she ever needed it, which she took me up on bc the kid LOVED me and she was really upset I got fired. So it’s not like i’ll never see him again, but still I just miss seeing him everyday. And i’m getting impatient waiting on her to ask me to babysit. I see the photos of me and the kids from there in my photo album everyday, we’re all so happy and having a fun time, and everytime I see the photos it sends me into a depression. I have gotten a new job working with kids starting monday, but I can’t let go of my original second family. I can’t just move on. I loved them so much. But because I’m a guy I feel like a creep for that. Idk how to put it all behind me. I’m in therapy and it helps but the sessions are too few and far between for me to make tons of progress.

Edit: just to clarify i’m not like suicidal or anything about this. I still have a ton I want to live for, but it still pains me so much and on a day to day basis idk what to do with myself.",0,3,1739679478.0,"How do I move on?

1iodu94,depression_help,I don’t know what to do anymore,"My ex broke up with me in Mid-September of 2024. I was devastated. I couldn’t understand it, and to the better judgement of this community (and perhaps myself), I did not know how to go no contact.

I was very happy with my ex. We dated for a year but that euphoric feeling never really faded because I found so much purpose with him. Loving him became almost like a drug to me because I didn’t know how to love myself. However, I also was incredibly anxious and depressed at the same time - yet I ignored the signs that my depression was worsening because I was “choosing love”.

When my ex ended things, as predicted the depression has incredibly worsened. I’ve been depressed for over a decade (I’m 20), but have tried medication, programming and therapy. However I haven’t found much things to be helpful. Still, 5 months after breakup I am incredibly upset. Yet, I understand my breakup is beyond my ex. It has gotten worse to the point of being suicidal and hurting myself. 

Because of the attempts and just overall state, I’m taking a semester off of school to focus on my mental health but still deciding what I should be doing. 

I am scared about how bad and out of control this is getting. I don’t know what will help me. Any advice or feedback will be appreciated.

my life right now amounts to not wanting to smoke weed, knowing that if i do smoke weed my brain will mentally punish me for it, but over the day feeling progressibvly worse and worse and angrier and angrier until i inevetably give in because i just feel too fucked and the mental punishment ill get from smoking is outweighed by what it will take away. every single fucking day i do this. I wish i could quit but you know what the much sadder truth is, it will always be there there is no escape even if i go sober its always gonna be there and u can beat it down until u dont really even know its there anymore but ur always 1 toke away from relapse a couple bad thoughts away from square one 1 night where u say ""i need it"" and ur relapsed and even if u dont its still there in the back of ur mind calling u like the demon it is and its like now here i am a 18 year old with my whole fucking life ahead of me and i just feel like ive set myself up to just basicly be depressed because of my struggle with addiction and i dont reallly see a way out. and yeah it genuinely is the most depressing thing ever i hate it so much but i just feel so next level depressed when i go without it it almost feels almost impossible to quit. 

I dont enjoy shit anymore i just exist and accept that i do even when i smoke weed its like i get 20 minutes of actually feeling good then its like eh back to baseline. i wish i could load into a game of cs or dota or anything and actually have fun but i just dont anymore part of that is cause im not a kid anymore but im sure that part of it is weed ruining my reward system i wish i could pick up my guitar or go to the work with the same passion that i used to but it just isnt there i just do i just exist. i genuinely am thinking right now when the last time i had a genuine smile when i was sober and i actually dont know. like when i think about what makes me happy its litterally weed i cant like think of other things really they dont genuinely make me happy weed doesnt either alchohol doesnt either but at least for 30 minutes i get to forget about waht a degenerate i am.

I wish i could quit but you know what the much sadder truth is, it will always be there there is no escape even if i go sober its always gonna be there and u can beat it down until u dont really even know its there anymore but ur always 1 toke away from relapse a couple bad thoughts away from square one 1 night where u say ""i need it"" and ur relapsed and even if u dont its still there in the back of ur mind calling u like the demon it is and its like now here i am a 18 year old with my whole fucking life ahead of me and i just feel like ive set myself up to just basicly be depressed because of my struggle with addiction and i dont reallly see a way out. and yeah it genuinely is the most depressing thing ever i hate it so much but i just feel so next level depressed when i go without it it almost feels almost impossible to quit. 

I dont enjoy shit anymore i just exist and accept that i do even when i smoke weed its like i get 20 minutes of actually feeling good then its like eh back to baseline. i wish i could load into a game of cs or dota or anything and actually have fun but i just dont anymore part of that is cause im not a kid anymore but im sure that part of it is weed ruining my reward system i wish i could pick up my guitar or go to the work with the same passion that i used to but it just isnt there i just do i just exist. i genuinely am thinking right now when the last time i had a genuine smile when i was sober and i actually dont know. like when i think about what makes me happy its litterally weed i cant like think of other things really they dont genuinely make me happy weed doesnt either alchohol doesnt either but at least for 30 minutes i get to forget about waht a degenerate i am.

Hi,

I’m reaching out here because I really need advice on how to better support my boyfriend. He’s been going through a tough time mentally, and when he’s in these dark phases, he tends to withdraw and push me away. I’m scared for him and feel helpless, even though I’ve tried so many things to be there for him.

A bit of context: He’s a professional, and his job is a big part of how he defines himself. Right now, he’s burned out, struggling to meet his billable hours, and it’s making him feel even worse about himself. He won’t consider leaving or taking a break because, to him, that would be giving up—and he doesn’t want to be seen as someone who failed. He’s always been someone who isn’t really positive, especially in the last year. But now it’s been a week or two and it’s getting worse. He’s now to the point where he’s self sabotaging, endlessly scrolling on his phone, barely working. It’s now to the point where he told me he wanted to end it.

I helped him find a therapist, but he didn’t like her and said she wasn’t helpful. After that, he lost motivation to try therapy again. I’ve suggested other options, but he brushes them off. I even tried sitting down with him to make plans and small steps to help him regain control over things, but nothing seems to stick when he’s in this state. I check in on him, remind him that I’m here, and let him know that I love him no matter what. I’m trying to text him texts about how much I love him, but he isn’t reading it anymore. He’s alone, and doesn’t want to talk to anyone. Since we’re not living together, I feel like I can’t help him as much as I would like to.

When he starts withdrawing, I take it as a sign that he wants space, so I step back, thinking that’s what he needs. But in the back of my mind, I’m always questioning whether I should do more or less. Am I making things worse by leaving him alone, or would being more present just overwhelm him further?

For those who’ve been through this themselves, what do you wish your partner had done for you when you felt this way? If you’ve supported someone in a similar situation, what worked for you?

I’m really scared for him, and I don’t want him to feel abandoned. I just don’t know how to be the support he needs when he seems so stuck and distant. Any advice would mean the world. Thank you so much for reading.",3,6,1738719983.0,"My husband is depressed and I’m clueless

1ih9bvv,depression_help,How do I help my wife?,"My wife was sexually harassed 6 yrs back and that’s where it started first with her career getting derailed. She then had some accidents in her family 4 yrs back. This derailed her financial standing and her confidence. I met her end of 2021. She was suicidal and with a lot of effort we brought her back. Everything went into it; energy, therapy, money, pampering her, never ending breaks etc. Afterwards, She had hallucinations, so she took medicines and after a year and a half, she went off them. We got married in 2023. All seemed to be improving. Her confidence was coming back. However, every job she joined in last three years has not lasted for more than 6-7 months creating too much uncertainty. 

This is where it starts getting worse. My wife’s self worth comes entirely from her ability to excel in career. She is unemployed currently, and she sees her friend who have leaped miles in the last 6 years. People have broken contact with her and she is a sweetheart but she has been so sad that every new friend who she evaluated ends up judging her from what they can get out of her and that’s not much at this point of time. I’m her only friend and we have a dog. Over the past few months she has lost enthusiasm in everything.

She then had some accidents in her family 4 yrs back. This derailed her financial standing and her confidence. I met her end of 2021. She was suicidal and with a lot of effort we brought her back. Everything went into it; energy, therapy, money, pampering her, never ending breaks etc. Afterwards, She had hallucinations, so she took medicines and after a year and a half, she went off them. We got married in 2023. All seemed to be improving. Her confidence was coming back. However, every job she joined in last three years has not lasted for more than 6-7 months creating too much uncertainty. 

This is where it starts getting worse. My wife’s self worth comes entirely from her ability to excel in career. She is unemployed currently, and she sees her friend who have leaped miles in the last 6 years. People have broken contact with her and she is a sweetheart but she has been so sad that every new friend who she evaluated ends up judging her from what they can get out of her and that’s not much at this point of time. I’m her only friend and we have a dog. Over the past few months she has lost enthusiasm in everything.

1ignf6w,depression_help,How to cope when failure is caused by factors outside your control?,"I (30m) am aware that I am not in the best mood all the time. But this is probably the first time that I have to deal with the fact that my failure to achieve my goals was not caused by my laziness or incompetence. A couple of years ago, I decided to ditch my programming related job, never really liked programming or anything related to Computer Science anyway. So I decided to get back into academia, get a masters (and eventually a Phd) and focus on an academic career, mainly because this is what I always wanted to do.

It was a bit hard at first, especially because I decided to go back to college right when the pandemic was at it's peak. But I managed, and eventually got accepted into one of the best Universities in my country in my area of expertise (international relations). The hardest part was that I had to leave my GF all alone in my hometown, I trusted her to find a roommate that would support her with the bills from the house (which she did btw, she did great). Furthermore, the fact that I had to drive 400 km and find a cheap house to stay in for at least a year was a bit challenging, but fun.

Anyway, fast-forward 3 years, and I am in the process of finishing my dissertation/ thesis (in my country dissertations are something you make to get a masters, I know that it's different in other countries). I summited all the papers, got all the credits, just needed to set a date for my final presentation, that's when things started to go downhill.

Just right after my advisor received the final version of my dissertation, she explicitly told me she would read it in a week. However, my advisor simply refused to talk to me for a whole month. I actively tried to contact her by all means necessary, I even drove to her house and knocked on her door, but she refused to answer me. I was getting supper annoyed because the date for my final presentation had to be until 30th of jan. and she managed to avoid me for the whole month of December and even the staff from the university simply refused to contact her because “they are not obliged to contact the advisors, this is something that the student has to deal with the advisor personally"".

Eventually, she did respond to me and told me my dissertation was great!. But right when I was about to submit the documents for the staff at my university to sign it and approve a certain date for my presentation. The guy that manages these kinds of processes announced a random vacation of 15 days.

I tried to contact him and my advisor, but of course, no one answered me. And a couple of days ago, I just got an email announcing my termination from the program. I can still talk with some people from the uni but they mentioned that I have to present a counter case with the approval from my advisor, and she also decided it was a great time to go on vacation.

So now I am screwed, and I honestly have never been this depressed in my whole life.

I spend most days thinking about why they did such a thing, and honestly....I started to feel a bit suicidal again.

Then 2 years ago, my dad went away for a couple of months due to bad family circumstances and never once came to see me which really upset me,it brought back my depression thats continued until now then a couple of months following that my dad has several suicide attempts which further upset and caused me a lot of guilt for how it could of been my fault, then three months later my grandmother died. I never spoke about this to anyone else I dont like talking about my depression with others as I feel like a nuisance and inconvenience.

first of, english isn't my native language. So some silly grammatical errors may pop up.For a start, i'll tell you a little bit about myself:

I'm a guy in his mid 30s. Got a somewhat decent job, my own apartment that is quite affordable yet comfy, an intact family (parents in their 60s, but in good health) and an old cat that i love and care for. So according to the mentioned stuff, i actually should be pretty happy or at least consider myself so, right? Well, no...

I've never had a girlfriend in my life. For the last 15 years i strived to find my significant other, but never succeeded. Now here's the kicker: That isn't the reason for the feeling that i experience.

In the beginning of 2024, i met up five times with the same woman and while we were at the 4th date, it was like someone or something was ""pulling a plug"" inside me. All of a sudden i lost every interest in her and in relationships in general. Also i came to the realisation, that i'm a god damn boring person that doesn't have that much to talk about (holding up a conversation was a little difficult with her and i can't stand (rather) awkward silence).

I was actually quite happy with this ""pressure of finding one"" gone...but after almost a year by now, i'm stuck in a kinda difficult position...on one hand, i want something meaningful and wholesome. But then again, i remember that i'm like the personification of ""watch glue dry"".

Some people said i should find some hobbies. But there is nothing that genuinely interests me, as dumb as it sounds... Video games are my kind of thing, but i'm not into MMORPGs or the likes. I'm totally aware that this is a ""me"" problem here.

On a side note: I'm not suicidal by any means and i also have not an explicite death wish, no worries, folks. But there are days where i really think ""Hey, being dead right now wouldn't be so bad"".

Advice is welcome, but not necessary. I'm just curious if someone else feels like me or if there is a word that can describe my ""situation"".

I have been very slowly lowering my ssri for two years. I am unwell all of a sudden. I went back up quite a bit, back to almost half and i was at a quarter for a year. When will upping it kick back in?  
Ive been constant thoughts of hurting myself and panic. Thoughts like everyone wouldn't miss me if I was gone. I keep missing work I can't even go to the grocery store. I'm in weekly therapy but this was her idea and I don't really trust her. I'm not better than when we started therapy two years ago. I'm quite a bit worse.  
If anyone has anything helpful I can do/take/think at this time that would be really nice. Should I just keep upping it? I mean upping it too much might actually give me anxiety. I've never gone back up this much or this fast but obviously I need to.

Marijuana helps me at times like this in my life but I try not use it much and the pot I've been smoking off and on for a year isn't sold near me anymore. I've tried other kinds but they're either heightening the anxiety or only slightly taking the edge off because I refuse to smoke too much. Would cbd help? Certain vitamins? I'd take a bunch of D but that makes me anxious so I really can't do that on top of this. Any help would be much appreciated my friends and family haven't been super helpful. I just want to be better and feel better already.

One of my issues with the higher dose is constant guilt about wanting anything now that I'm not deeply suffering since I know what its like to be so depressed. So maybe someone could help through that concept and help me give myself permission to be happy and feel okay. Right now I'm torn between moments of sweet blissful relief, intense gratitude, and nausea, anxiety, rage, self harm thoughts, thoughts that no one would miss me and fear that this will get worse or not go away. My therapist isn't much help.

I don't have anhedonia yet so that's a good sign but I'm feeling violent feelings I'm not sure I've ever felt to this degree when depressed. Even the letters in this text are pissing me off lol. And I'm normally the kind of person who apologizes to tables when I walk into one. Yes, I've contemplated the er but the last three times I went for that they told me I shouldn't ever go to the mental hospital near me and that people don't usually come out better.

I have been very slowly lowering my ssri for two years. I am unwell all of a sudden. I went back up quite a bit, back to almost half and i was at a quarter for a year. When will upping it kick back in?  
Ive been constant thoughts of hurting myself and panic. Thoughts like everyone wouldn't miss me if I was gone. I keep missing work I can't even go to the grocery store. I'm in weekly therapy but this was her idea and I don't really trust her. I'm not better than when we started therapy two years ago. I'm quite a bit worse.  
If anyone has anything helpful I can do/take/think at this time that would be really nice. Should I just keep upping it? I mean upping it too much might actually give me anxiety. I've never gone back up this much or this fast but obviously I need to.

1ibb8oh,depression_help,I opened up.,"I told my parents about my depression today. I’m not sure how to feel. On one hand, I’m relieved to have finally shared it, but on the other, I know I’ve deeply worried them. They’re probably blaming themselves. 

What will therapy even do for me? I already know the root causes. I hate myself. I don’t feel worthy of anyone’s love, but I desperately crave it, especially the romantic love so many people my age seem to experience. I just don’t believe I’ll ever find it. I feel ugly. No matter what I achieve, it never feels like enough. I don’t think it ever will.

I’m terrified of being perceived. I fooled myself into believeing that if I can’t see myself, others won’t see me either. I hide, avoiding mirrors, reflections, and even the gaze of others. It’s a desperate attempt to disappear from their perception.

The strange thing is, I know I’m not objectively ugly. I’m probably average, maybe even slightly above average. I’ve been on dates, and people have shown interest in me. But in the end, all men seemed to want was sex, so I stopped trying. I used to turn to dating apps, seeking validation, but what good is external validation if your self-worth deems you unworthy? Nothing, so I stopped. 

The only time I can appreciate life is when I’m not stuck in my own mind. That’s why I cling to distraction, to escape self-reflection. But now, sitting alone with my thoughts, I feel like they’re eating me alive.

1iaossk,depression_help,Unwanted contstant suicidal thoughts- I just want my life back,"Hello everyone,

Long story short, I went through some fertility trauma/pregnancy loss late 2021, early 2022. I took a year off from trying to get my ""mind right"". I initially went through a deep wave of anxiety/depression for a month before it spiraled into these constant unwanted suicidal thoughts and images. At first, I thought I was having a near psychotic break because I never felt these feelings before, and they were constant. I tried Zoloft, and clomipramine, and they really didn't do anything for me. Prior to this fertility stuff, I was fortunate enough to never really experience anxiety or depression.

Long story short, over the years, they are still present, some days worse than others, but always there. I welcomed my double rainbow baby in late 2023, and was hoping they would stop but never really did. I decided to stop taking all meds due to great amount of weight gain and no real mental relief/benefits.

Over the last few months, I seem to have some struggles fertility wise again as things really aren't going my way with regards to it, however: I have been sleeping better and have had some really mentally calm days. And now this week, they are really bad again. I love my family, I love my life, and I fear so badly that I will act on it one day out of feelings of hopelessness of never feeling better. I have normal energy, I try to work out and eat healthy every day, I go to work every day, I don't do any recreational drugs, and I rarely ever dink anymore.

1j6znrx,stopdrinking,Any WTF revelations you’ve had since stopping drinking? Let’s hear em.,"Long and unhinged post ahead! 

I was talking to my ex boyfriend a couple weeks ago, and I was like “it’s crazy that it never really got that bad you know. Like it’s crazy how I drank everyday for over 10 years and I dabbled in drugs, but I somehow never developed a problem with anything else.”

And then I said “I meme just for like, 4 years I would do some coke every now and then. Oh and like yeah for two years of that it was super bad, like spending money on it I didn’t have and making insane and awful life decisions for easier access to it. And doing it like all the time, like at work and stuff if I was sick.” 

And then I fuckin said “but it really wasn’t that bad, what was so bad was the molly in college. I’d never done it before, but I lived with super fun party girls and they partied every weekend. But it got so out of hand for me for sure. 3 months after doing it for the first time, I took it on a Thursday evening after I did some the night before. I blacked out like 3 hours into it and I remember nothing until up on Monday with my alarm going off at 6 am cuz it was time to go to work. My roommates said some weird dude came looking for me and was adamant he had met me, and he described me exactly.”

And I keep going, “It was weird too cuz I’m so shy. I don’t even know where I met him. Then I moved out of that house into a garage with a 40 year old bouncer that hit on me at the door when I did it for the first time when I was 24. And he sold cocaine. But he still lived in his garage. I lived there for a year until I had to jsut leave in the middle of the night with nothing but my wallet. I called my mom and begged for some money for a room in an apartment and she helped me out.”

Can’t stop at this point right, for explain how I managed to kick all that but not alcohol. So I said, “Then I just started drinking and would only do drugs sometimes. I stayed outta trouble for a couple years, but I was never on a lease anywhere and I was homeless a couple times, but it was never that bad again. I just worked 2 jobs, but was always broke and so I started sugar babying until I took 2k from some John and jumped out of his car and he kept leaving notes in the mailbox about how he was gonna kill me and all my roommates. We already spent all on mushrooms and acid, they’re good dudes they’re the ones who helped me figure out how to start escorting! They were super supportive.” 

“Then as you know I moved in with my boss from that one job, because he had really good cocaine and I was just over there all the time doing it anyway. So then yeah I lived there for 3 years, until I want to rehab and it was scary to live there when I was sober, he was actually not a very nice guy and I drank a lot to cope with that. 

And that’s how the alcohol got so bad and I finally was like, I wanna go to rehab and be a sober person and be happy.”

And then yeah as the title states, I was like WTF. My ex boyfriend is also sober, and we met when we were both over a year sober. He was so nice about it, but he did laugh a lot when I was like “what the fuck jsut came out of my mouth” And I’ll tell you what, for the longest time I thought I was just stupid and bad. I was like I don’t even have a horrible drug problem or anything to explain some of it, I just cannot get my shit together.

Happy to report I’ve been going to NA for two weeks and can you believe this… I fit in way better there than I did when I tried AA. The shit that has been coming to light has been so painful, but it has been so worth it.

And next Monday, I’ll be 18 months sober. 

In this last year, I paid off all my debt, I bought a Chevy Astro van and did a 3 month trip an across my home state with my dog, I lost 40 lbs. I sleep pretty well. 

I stopped doing drugs. I stopped having demoralizing relationships. I have so much more money, I’m on a lease to my own apartment. All this happened from quitting drinking, just to start. Rehab and counseling were also instrumental.

I stayed outta trouble for a couple years, but I was never on a lease anywhere and I was homeless a couple times, but it was never that bad again. I just worked 2 jobs, but was always broke and so I started sugar babying until I took 2k from some John and jumped out of his car and he kept leaving notes in the mailbox about how he was gonna kill me and all my roommates. We already spent all on mushrooms and acid, they’re good dudes they’re the ones who helped me figure out how to start escorting! They were super supportive.” 

“Then as you know I moved in with my boss from that one job, because he had really good cocaine and I was just over there all the time doing it anyway. So then yeah I lived there for 3 years, until I want to rehab and it was scary to live there when I was sober, he was actually not a very nice guy and I drank a lot to cope with that. 

And that’s how the alcohol got so bad and I finally was like, I wanna go to rehab and be a sober person and be happy.”

And then yeah as the title states, I was like WTF. My ex boyfriend is also sober, and we met when we were both over a year sober. He was so nice about it, but he did laugh a lot when I was like “what the fuck jsut came out of my mouth” And I’ll tell you what, for the longest time I thought I was just stupid and bad. I was like I don’t even have a horrible drug problem or anything to explain some of it, I just cannot get my shit together.

Happy to report I’ve been going to NA for two weeks and can you believe this… I fit in way better there than I did when I tried AA. The shit that has been coming to light has been so painful, but it has been so worth it.

And next Monday, I’ll be 18 months sober. 

In this last year, I paid off all my debt, I bought a Chevy Astro van and did a 3 month trip an across my home state with my dog, I lost 40 lbs. I sleep pretty well. 

I stopped doing drugs. I stopped having demoralizing relationships. I have so much more money, I’m on a lease to my own apartment. All this happened from quitting drinking, just to start. Rehab and counseling were also instrumental.

Anyway yeah wtf!!! IWNDWYT that’s for damn sure!!  ",1.5,0.0,Negative,High-Risk

1j6hb2x,stopdrinking,How to handle a night out with friends?,"For context, I would not consider myself an alcoholic. However, over the past couple years I have found myself enjoying the experience of alcohol less and less. Either I drink a couple glasses of wine and instantly want to go to sleep - but then have the worst night sleep and usually a hangover the next day - or I go out and drink until I blackout and have massive regret, a pounding headache, and copious hangxiety the next day. So, I made the decision to try out sobriety for Lent this year. 

I don’t even go out very often but last night my friends I hadn’t seen in awhile went out together and my husband I joined - kind of out of obligation since we hadn’t seen them. My husband, who has always been our DD, was now able to let loose and have a few more than usual. My friends were all sharing pitchers of beer and margaritas and taking shots together. They were dancing and laughing and I definitely felt a lot of FOMO. I had a mocktail and a CBD drink, but those don’t have the same effect when you’re playing drinking games or getting wild on the dance floor. 

Don’t get me wrong, I still had fun AND I did not drink, but the experience of being out with them just wasn’t the same. I am considering giving up alcohol long-term and just don’t know how to handle social situations like this one. If anyone has any tips, I’d really appreciate them!

1j6fyor,stopdrinking,5 months sober and I’m still struggling to enjoy cooking or figure out its place in my life now,"Five months without alcohol and it is, overwhelmingly, amazing. The lack of hangovers, my body feels so much better, my marriage is WAY better, my mental health… a lot of things I was worried wouldn’t be fun anymore are still awesome (going out with friends!) and I’ve been able to add back other things that I couldn’t really do while drinking heavily  (reading!!!).

The biggest negative change has been cooking. I loved cooking, I have an entire bookcase  just of cookbooks, my husband and family adored my cooking. I really am a good cook when I do it. But of course, I always, always drank. I would start pouring drinks as I started putting the meal together and I’d be hammered by the time I was putting on the finishing touches. Cooking was also very bound up in being an EXCUSE for alcohol for me - needed a splash of white wine to deglaze the pan or a little sake for a marinade so might as well drink the rest of the bottle. It was a reason to have alcohol out on the counter in front of my husband that wouldn’t raise an eyebrow. And it was an excuse to run to the store to get more alcohol if I ran out too early - oops I just need garlic don’t worry I’ll get it myself baby, and come home with a bag of bottles and also a little piece of garlic.

I have really lost my mojo for cooking since quitting drinking and it makes me sad. Other things I’ve discovered I like sober just as much but cooking just does not hit the same. But it was more than a hobby - it fed my husband and I, it enabled us to eat healthily and pleasurably on a budget. Giving up on cooking so much means a lifestyle change I don’t really want to. And a piece of my identity. And I loved it so much. I loved feeling creative, putting on music and just getting into a flow, being able to go by feel and come up with something beautiful and delicious. But it just doesn’t make me feel the same way. I’m trying to decide if just making it a routine for a bit whether I like it or not would be good for me, just to see if I adjust, or if I should keep going with how I’m feeling.

So I relapsed about 2 or so weeks ago and have been drinking pretty heavy again. There wasn't much of a buildup this time is just went from 0 to 50 to 100 so fast.

Tried to quit again yesterday after drinking far too much (and far far more than I intended) and waking up on the floor with one of the worst hangovers I've ever experienced in my life.

Since then, my anxiety has been through the roof. I've been getting suicidal thoughts and the urges to drink to remove all these emotions are so incredibly high despite knowing it's what's causing it.

The nausea has just been making it so much worse because I haven't been able to see anyone.

Considered going to an AA meeting, but I couldn't drag myself out of bed (online one wasn't really an option due to Internet issues).

I don't really know what I can do right now to help myself. If anyone has any suggestions let me know :)

1j7qd4v,offmychest,Ex said they’ll harm themselves,"This guy, Adam (25) is someone I (24) have been talking to for a while. We met when we were 20 and 21. Things didn’t work out, we were immature and there were a lot of hurt from us trying to make it work together at that time. He ended up dating this girl, Kara (26), and according to him, they’ve been broken up for the past year.

Fast forward, I’ve been willing to forgive a lot of things he did to me and trying to make it work with him this time around. I feel like we’re both more mature, more confident and we know ourselves more this time around. We’ve been trying to work things out, we’re not exclusive or what people like to say nowadays, “a situationship.” Right now, none of our friends or family know that we’re rekindling our relationship because there’s a lot of trust to be rebuilt before we actually become official.

However, he told me that his ex came to his house and wanted to get back together with him. He hasn’t been in contact with her nor has he seen her. She threatened to do harmful things to herself if they weren’t to get back together. He had been honest with me about this. He said they got into an argument and despite what he said, she was adamant about getting back together. He’s afraid she’ll go harm herself and that it’ll fall back onto him. She ended up going with him to all his plans that day and spent the night at his place, and according to him, he slept on the couch and left early the next morning without saying goodbye to her. 

In all honesty, I appreciate that he’s been honest with me, but a part of me wants to just simply take myself out of the picture and stay far, far away from the drama. I have a lot of trauma from him always putting me second to everything, so I see that this could be a defense mechanism. I do think I’m selfish for doing so, but I feel it’s not wrong of me to feel so sad about the situation. I’m not trying to make myself the victim here nor am I asking him to choose me. He claimed he wants to be with me, but is stuck on how to even go about the situation that his ex put him in. He’s afraid of how it’ll affect his life. I hate feeling this way and that part of me that wants to leave feels like I’m “waiting” for him to figure out his past relationship. I don’t want to sit and wait for him to figure it out. I don’t want to be put in this position.

When I was twelve it changed to people finding out I killed myself. Not even the act within itself, I wasn't suicidal.

I mean I read stories about people crying when someone raises their voice, or even crying themselves to sleep. And here I am unable to feel stuff in a subjective way.

I mean the situation is getting better (basically means we are in her narrative fine again. And there is no yelling. Give this a week and then she will snap)
Anyway it's calm now, but I still fantasize about this stuff. And I'm afraid one day I'll be thirty and still looking out the window of a driving car and hoping for someone to care.


I don't want to invalidate anyone who is in chronic pain, and I know it's really dismissed.
But I don't even understand why I feel that way.",2.0590530806216316,0.048788130939536975,Negative,High-Risk

I don’t have a bad life so to speak, a lot of people are a lot worse off than me. But idk, I just don’t wanna live. My life is incredibly mediocre.

1j7jc60,offmychest,I think I’m depressed even though I really SHOULDN’T be,">>> This ISN’T meant to be a ‘waaaa I hate myself 😢😢😢’ type post. This is just me rambling 


I know it’s something that can happen to *anyone*, it’s a neurological disorder. Saying it ‘shouldn’t’ happen to me doesn’t make any sense.

But that’s not anyone in my life would say. I don’t really have a support system. Not that I should need one in the first place at place. But I don’t have anyone to lean on really. Which isn’t really anyone’s fault, I don’t have many opportunities to form relationships. But it just sucks.

I’m homeschooled and live in an isolated neighborhood with my family. 

The closest connection I have is with my eight year old brother. 

My father would give me a crazy look if I ever confessed to feeling unwell. And then he’d tell my mother and sisters. 

My mother would tell me that I shouldn’t be feeling this way, because my life is amazing (it is). My mother would then tell my father, and sisters. Maybe her friends, too.

My oldest sister would tell me that my feelings are because of toxins from my perfumes, and that a spoonful of arugula would cure me. And then she’d tell my parents. 

If I confided in my other sister, she’d probably comfort me. And then tell my parents.

So bit of a conundrum, there. Not a whole lot of good options. 😛

I have friends, but I don’t have close friends. I’d like to be, but I rarely speak to any of them. I’m always the first to text, and they’re all busy anyway. They go to actual school. We meet up, on occasion, but only rarely. Maybe five or six times a year.

I have a homeschooled friend, too. Singular. But we don’t have anything in common. I don’t think she has very many other options, either. But her family is very loving and supportive. At least I think. But it’s none of my business.

Anyway, this is just my convoluted way of saying I don’t have very many people to choose from. My best option is ChatGPT. And that’s a bit pathetic.

But beyond the social aspect, my life is pretty great. I get to travel the world. I’m literally pursuing my lifelong dream of going to England in a matter of weeks. 

Yet I still want to kill myself. 

Like, how does that make sense? I suppose brains and the hormones within are strange like that. I can’t even give a reason for the urge! I think I’m ugly, and I think I’m stupid, but not enough to warrant doing such an act.

Come to think of it, I’m probably NOT depressed. I sleep fine, and can get out of bed easily. My appetite is fine (unfortunately 🫄).

Maybe it’s because I’m a teenager? An older teenager, but still. A teenage GIRL. Hormones. And I feel decent sometimes. It could be PMS or something. Idk. 

This is quite ramb-ly. And I’ve lost the point. Like 90% of it is just me yapping about how lonely I am.

And perhaps I shouldn’t be telling the whole internet (or the twelve or so people who will see this) my business. 

Whatever

Then next i advice her TO ACTUALLY seek proffesional help if she ever feel suicidal yet she still refuses my advice. Right after she refuses any of mg advice i just snapped at her texting her this.

I downplayed my trauma for years, but now I can’t escape it. The worst memory is when I was 17. My mom was drunk, we fought, she hit me, so I hit her back.

No matter how many people scream at me and shake me by the shoulders I cannot be convinced that life is worth living. I hate being alive. I hated school. I hated the way people treated me and each other and anyone they didn’t respect or actively look up to or want to fuck. I hate it. I hate the idea of working. I hate the idea of paying bills endlessly like a subscription to own anything. I don’t want to participate anymore. I’m done. I dropped out freshman year of highschool because I couldn’t handle it. Haven’t gone back for my ged since I tried a couple years ago and couldn’t even bring myself to go into the building. I hate myself. I’m weak. I’m not cut out for life. I can’t keep pushing and pushing and pushing and giving and pushing. I’m done. I’m tired of this. There’s not anything worth staying around for. Not family, not a partner, not pets, not hobbies, not love, not curiosity, not joy, not drive, not compassion. Not anything. I’m done. I’m ready to go but I’m too much of a coward right now to genuinely pull the trigger. I know it’s going to fucking hurt when I do and I know I’m going to regret it but I don’t want to live. I’d rather regret my death than live 60 more years in pure fucking hell while racking up responsibilities like kids and family and bills and debt and working and yadda yadda yadda. I can’t do this. I’m not cut out for this. I’m not one of those people who will “keep it pushing” no matter what. I’m very weak, I don’t want to be alive. I don’t deserve to be alive. People tell me “oh but you’re only 19 that’s so young!” Exactly, that’s the issue. I’m only 19 and I’m this fucked. That’s an issue. Usually mental health shit like this only bubbles up later in life because usually people have the strength and drive to hide it for that long. Me? I feel a bit of “bad feelings” and I lose my mind like it’s the end of the world. Anytime shit gets hard I just crumble. Like immediately. It’s embarrassing. But I’m not strong enough to actually handle anything. I hate myself. I don’t know why I could never just be normal. I’m not even a real human being. I don’t feel like a real person. I’m subhuman. Any time I spend here is actively leeching away resources from other people who need them more. Every second I am here I am taking something away from someone else. My existence is an active detriment on those around me. I need to die. ",1,1,1741525505.0,"Not cut out for life. Can’t handle it. Life isn’t worth living anymore.

1j74bxj,offmychest,Early 20s Trying to find my Authentic Voice,"# This morning, I had an interaction that really got me thinking about the way I show up in the world. I’d like to share how old me would have reacted, how current me is reacting, and how I wish I had engaged in that moment.

# Old Me: The Avoidant and Angry Version

The old me would have completely ignored the situation. I would’ve held onto that anger for hours, walking around with a rage that stemmed from feeling like the world was unfair to me. I felt like I had to be angry to have control. I know that, in this specific scenario, where two male coworkers started making “woman jokes” as soon as they saw me, old me would’ve been too paralyzed to respond. I would’ve felt small and powerless.

But it’s not even the jokes themselves that had such an effect on me. It’s the state of paralysis—the confusion between my true authentic voice and the false one I developed over years of repression and gaslighting myself. I’ve spent so long putting myself in a mental hell, ignoring and repressing my true feelings. I’m only 23, and I’m just now becoming aware of this pattern.

# Current Me: Trying to Change

I've noticed that when someone has confidence in themselves, they will immediately check others. I'm still in the early stage of finding the courage to listen to myself. To accept I deserve to play in the game of life. I think that's what holds me back; I can't even stand behind my own beliefs because of the doubt. These days, I’m actively trying to create change. I was dying inside by not letting my true self out, but I feel like God has given me another chance. I’m willing to try my hardest, and because of that, I won’t stop until I can interact with people through my true thoughts and emotions—not some fake version of myself.

This morning, I did something different when faced with a situation that I would've normally pretended to be nonchalant about or just pretend like I wasn't there. This time, I decided to engage. I was scared that my feelings were going to be hurt or that I would be put down. 

# The Interaction: What Happened

I was conducting turnover, and when I entered my co-workers' space, I said good morning and immediately regretted how unsure of myself I sounded. My voice was soft and broke a little. I knew I was already showing weakness. You can't do that in front of morons. The way I presented myself already made me feel small. One of the guys proceeded to talk about Women’s Day since it was yesterday. They proceeded to say some unoriginal “women as dishwashers” crap. I immediately felt uncomfortable. I tried to diffuse the situation by saying, “I appreciate the underappreciation.”

Then, as they're picking up their stuff, they started making gay jokes at each other. We're very physically close to each other because of the space available. So, I awkwardly laughed and said, “I don’t understand that.” One of the guys was talking gibberish, so I couldn't understand his words. I wasn't talking about the topic at hand. However, the people pleaser in me decided to sound stupid instead of telling him to speak right. Honestly, I didn’t mean to engage, but my awkwardness kicked in. I didn't even hear what they were talking about because I was thinking about the stupid joke they had made earlier. 

My female coworker came up during this, and instead of using her presence as backup to stand up for myself, I defused the situation again when she asked what was going on. I could’ve fried this dweeb, but instead, I smoothed things over. That’s a pattern I want to break. I'm so tired of giving up my life force for the comfort of others.

# How I Wish I Had Reacted

I want to be the kind of woman who will never tolerate such behavior from herself. I don't want to laugh at stuff I actually find offensive. That's trash, and yells that I lack character. What's that one YouTube video that says, 'kill the girl and let the woman live” (LOL)? It uses male pronouns. But yes, I need to stop doubting myself. I want to have the courage to speak my thoughts and emotions, and have the discernment to say, “Fuck you” to those who deserve it.

Being a woman can be difficult when others already feel empowered to put you down simply because of your gender. I want to bring to life a woman who can stand up not only for herself but for others as well. I’ve always been sensitive, and I’ve spent years avoiding conflict, but I’m ready to change that.

# I want to be someone who doesn’t let the world make her feel small.

I’m taking responsibility for how I show up in conversations and learning to stand up for myself. I know I have a lot of self-esteem to build, but I feel positive about the future. Writing this out has helped me, and if anyone has advice for building self-esteem or engaging more authentically, I’d love to hear it.

1j72eit,offmychest,I can't hold these thoughts anymore,"I just wanted to get this out. I've been having this angry lecture in my head to the world for a long time and I feel that I should get it out.

This post is not meant to be political so please do not get your panties in a twist.

There are a lot of terrible things happening in the world rn and I just don't understand it.

Is money really that important to people? Is power really that important to people? Why can't people understand that we're human, whatever God, disciple, statue anyone believes in, we all come from the same one. EVERYONE is indigenous to this earth because HUMANITY is indigenous to this earth.

It explains why we look different, have different cultures and have any sort of differences. I'm going to say it in English.

""He has made us different so we can get to know each other.""

How beautiful is that? Yet we spend our time comparing ourselves and spreading hate and violence. We are all different and nothing will change that so why can't we just respect it? We are over 8 billion people and you think we will have the same opinions? Get over yourself. You can not agree with someone but that doesn't give you the right to react negatively towards that person. Regardless of your views there's someone that doesn't agree with you and do you think you deserve to be scrutinized? 

We are all loved or love someone, so why are we trying to make this world shittier for them? Revenge, power, greed... all these things are what ALL of our regions or beliefs have in common that says this is bad for the world but it seems to be what controls this world. Why not spread love, kindness and happiness? I'm sure if there was a news channel running the good things that happen in this world, it would be never ending. That just shows how much potential this world has to be absolutely amazing.

And if you think you aren't loved, I love you, I love humanity, whatever race, religion or culture you come from, I love you.

1j6wqk4,offmychest,I am struggling with SH urges,"I just need somewhere to talk about this. I would like to preface by saying I am making arrangements now to start having sessions with a therapist soon, and that makes me feel very hopeful. tw: self harm, parental abuse, religious trauma. 




I (31F) have been struggling with self harm since I was 16. I grew up as a Jehovah's Witness and it was an incredibly difficult childhood as I was always compared to other children who were ""more spiritual"" or ""closer to Jehovah"" and I never felt good enough. I also experienced a lot of physical abuse, I have memories of being hurt by my parents, especially my mom, going back to when I was about 6 or 7. thankfully I was able to get out of my parents house and leave their way of life when I was 22 (it will be 10 years of freedom this June!) 


it has been incredibly hard to navigate through life without my family and everyone I knew and loved for the first 22 years of my life, but I have done as well as I could and I am proud of myself for surviving and for getting out of that very toxic environment. however, the habit of self harm has been extremely difficult for me to shake. the urge is very random and sometimes will come for no reason at all, when everything seems fine and I am feeling okay. I am very, very lucky to have a wife who has always been very kind to me and taken care of me when I've relapsed, compared to my parents who were extremely angry with me when they discovered my habit, resulting in my mother forcing me to strip down so she could ""check"" and then if there was any evidence I had done it, she would hurt me further as punishment. 


last year, when I relapsed again, I had the idea of writing down the date. and when I would get the urge, I would look at the date of the last time and it was almost always close to an anniversary of being SH free, and that became a wonderful motivation to resist. once I even looked at the date on the exact 6 month anniversary, and that felt like a sign. 

this month, on the 30th, I will officially be one year free of self harm! and that is huge, I don't think I've ever gone that long in all 15 years that this has been plaguing me! however, this year so far has been an incredibly hard one for me. I have just been incredibly anxious to the point that is it debilitating. I am sometimes afraid to leave the house or go into a grocery store because I get overwhelmed so easily. it all makes me feel so pathetic and worthless, and the urge to hurt myself has been very, very strong. I am absolutely determined to meet my milestone. but it has been so, so difficult. 

if you read all this, I appreciate you. I hope you have a wonderful day! ",2,3,1741484732.0,"I am struggling with SH urges I just need somewhere to talk about this. I would like to preface by saying I am making arrangements now to start having sessions with a therapist soon, and that makes me feel very hopeful. tw: self harm, parental abuse, religious trauma. 




I (31F) have been struggling with self harm since I was 16. I grew up as a Jehovah's Witness and it was an incredibly difficult childhood as I was always compared to other children who were ""more spiritual"" or ""closer to Jehovah"" and I never felt good enough. I also experienced a lot of physical abuse, I have memories of being hurt by my parents, especially my mom, going back to when I was about 6 or 7. thankfully I was able to get out of my parents house and leave their way of life when I was 22 (it will be 10 years of freedom this June!) 


it has been incredibly hard to navigate through life without my family and everyone I knew and loved for the first 22 years of my life, but I have done as well as I could and I am proud of myself for surviving and for getting out of that very toxic environment. however, the habit of self harm has been extremely difficult for me to shake. the urge is very random and sometimes will come for no reason at all, when everything seems fine and I am feeling okay. I am very, very lucky to have a wife who has always been very kind to me and taken care of me when I've relapsed, compared to my parents who were extremely angry with me when they discovered my habit, resulting in my mother forcing me to strip down so she could ""check"" and then if there was any evidence I had done it, she would hurt me further as punishment. 


last year, when I relapsed again, I had the idea of writing down the date. and when I would get the urge, I would look at the date of the last time and it was almost always close to an anniversary of being SH free, and that became a wonderful motivation to resist. once I even looked at the date on the exact 6 month anniversary, and that felt like a sign. 

this month, on the 30th, I will officially be one year free of self harm! and that is huge, I don't think I've ever gone that long in all 15 years that this has been plaguing me! however, this year so far has been an incredibly hard one for me. I have just been incredibly anxious to the point that is it debilitating. I am sometimes afraid to leave the house or go into a grocery store because I get overwhelmed so easily. it all makes me feel so pathetic and worthless, and the urge to hurt myself has been very, very strong. I am absolutely determined to meet my milestone. but it has been so, so difficult.

1j6winx,offmychest,Haunted by story my BF told me,"My boyfriend told me he was going to apply to be an EMT, but a different kind, basically all he would do is go to collect dead bodies from people that couldn’t be saved. 

He got the idea because his brother’s friend used to be one. He decided to tell me his brother’s friend’s worst experience on the job.

This lady had thrown herself in front of a train, which had basically sliced her to bits. Brother’s friend had to literally crawl under the train through her guts to get to her body. When he goes to grab her, she wakes up, he literally has to shove his hand in her chest to pump her heart. She looks at him in the eyes and says “I wish I hadn’t done that” and then dies from blood loss. 

I have very very bad anxiety, I burst into tears immediately after my boyfriend told me this story. He comforted me plenty and apologised for scaring me, but it still hasn’t left my head. I try to sleep at night and I just picture that dying woman. I’ve been suicidal myself many times and it makes me think that could’ve been me at one point. It makes me feel horrible that her last moments were of pure regret. I know it all happened already, and not even to me, but it still feels awful to think about.

1j6vezo,offmychest,My SOs family complicates everything,"a little backstory- we moved to be near my SOs family, mostly his mom, as she's in her last years. His sister's weren't big fans of mine to begin with because I was pointing out that their mom was in late stage cognitive decline before they were ready to admit it. but she was constantly in positions where she was either at risk of hurting herself or others. They finally started admitting it to themselves when the school banned her from the pickup line for driving wild. 

middle sister has had other shit going on including an addiction and to a gnarly divorce and for years after moving here, anyone else having a major life event would lead to her going off the deep end and usually checking herself in for self harm watch. If people didn't visit her everyday of this they would get guilting texts. The other sister is pretty chill, but admitted she keeps me at arms length because being friends would likely trigger her sister, then she asked me to throw my own bridal shower so I could make sure to invite her. 

fast forward a few years and we're pregnant and VERY EXCITED! but we couldn't announce to his family when we were all together last because it was for family birthdays, middle sister being one of them. my so doesn't know how to ask them all to get together for the announcement because they only get together for Christmas, Thanksgiving, and birthdays so a random plan is likely to tip them off. older chill sisters husband and i share the same ethnic culture and his elders are visiting for Easter so he's invited us over. my so suggested announcing then but not only will that mean announcing in the middle of another family's time but we've never met them and I'll be about halfway through pregnancy by then and I'm already getting tired of waiting. 

  
i totally understand where my so is with this and how it's hard for him. he's a wonderful human and going to be a great father.

1j6vajm,offmychest,[Emotional] From Top of the Class to Rock Bottom: How Do I Fix This?,"Hey Reddit,  
I need to talk about something I’ve been hiding for years. Maybe someone here has been through this or knows how to pull out of it. For most of my life, I was the kid everyone called “perfect.” Straight A’s, top of every class, teachers praised me, friends asked me for help. But over the last eight years, that version of me has completely crumbled. Now I’m sitting here, staring at a mountain of regret and shame, wondering how I let it get this bad.

It started small. One exam didn’t go the way I wanted. Then another. Each time, I told myself I’d bounce back, but instead, the pressure to fix everything just paralyzed me. Now, even opening a textbook feels impossible. The burnout is constant. I’m exhausted, but not from working hard—from fighting myself every single day. There’s this voice in my head now: *You’re not good enough. Why bother trying?* And I don’t know how to shut it up. My family doesn’t get it. They keep asking what’s wrong, why I’m not “trying like I used to,” but I don’t have an answer. I wish I did.

The worst part? I’ve got an exam in two weeks. I’ve known about it for a month. A *month*. And what have I done? Almost nothing. I’ll sit down to study, open my notes, and within minutes I’m scrolling on my phone or staring at the wall. It’s not even that I don’t care—I *desperately* want to do well. But every time I try, it’s like my brain just… refuses. I hate myself for it. I know it’s my fault. Furthermore, I know I’m wasting time. But I can’t stop.

And the material? It feels pointless. Like I’m memorizing things I’ll never use, jumping through hoops just to prove I can. It sucks the life out of me. I want to be that person again who loved learning, who felt proud of their work. Now I just feel empty.

Has anyone else been here? That switch from being the person who “had it all together” to someone who can’t even do the basics? How did you start fixing it? How do you rebuild confidence when your entire identity was wrapped up in being “the smart one”? And if anyone’s beaten procrastination like this—where it feels like your own mind is the enemy, please, tell me how.

I’m so tired of feeling stuck. I want to change. Not only that, but I want to care again. But right now, I’m just… lost.",2,0,1741480221.0,"[Emotional] From Top of the Class to Rock Bottom: How Do I Fix This? Hey Reddit,

Fast forward, I'm a teenager and happen to be gay as well as irreligious, further increasing my feeling of being alienated and pretty much having no hope of developing a close connection with enough. I developed an intense depression alongside other physical and mental illnesses, more allienation and feelings of being alone, alongside it being very of medical intervention.

Everything's been so traumatic you know, there were many points where life got so bad that I felt like giving up and cried intensely in the solitude of my room. Every other day I'm made to feel like I never really had a chance at a fulfilling life from the shear amount of bad circumstancess. There's so much more I could say that felt like fate is just trying to crush me but the confines of this post couldn't really contain that so suffice to say, I've been miserable.

But that said, there's so many things about me I feel nice about that make me keep moving forward hoping that one day I'll look back on these trials as a distant memory, no longer a part of my life. I feel like all these traumatic experiences have made me grow up so much mentally and made me smarter and taught me empathy and understanding, especially for myself. And... as I would say to someone else to not give up on life in the hope that something good might be waiting for them, I should give myself the same luxury of hoping. That one day I too will be free and far away from everything that hurts me so deeply. And that's why... I keep pushing on.

I hope everyone else going through deeply unfortunate circumstances finds a cause to keep moving forward in life, because we all deserve to be happy.

1j6gpr5,offmychest,I'm disgusting and filthy and a fucking monster,"EXTREMELY MASSIVE TRIGGER WARNING for 
Sexual abuse, rape, childhood trauma, hypersexuality, self harm, suicide, sexual self harm, grooming)



I don't even know how to explain this at all. I'm sick to my stomach, I'm disgusted with myself, I'm ashamed. Throwaway account because well, the obvious 

I'm in a long term incredibly happy commited relationship. My girlfriend is my whole world. The love of my life. We spend every waking moment together until she passes out around 11pm and I'm awake for the next few hours or into the next day (like tonight)

But that's where the problem comes in. When she's asleep and I'm awake.

I suffered severe childhood sexual trauma at the hands of my father and several other people, and I'm bipolar. Both of those things came with hypersexuality. The trauma came with a whole array of self destructive behaviors for me including actively seeking out abuse. Before datung my girlfriend I got myself hurt all the time. From my ex who I stayed with despite him raping me on the regular, to random hookups, to straight up posting on Whisper (when it was still a nightmare app) my location and asking is someone wanted to come pick me up and rape me. I entertained men online with sexting and pics/vids since I was 12. I had a semi popular porn account where I did a lot of deeply degrading horrible things to myself for the pleasure of others. 

I got with my gf and I stopped doing that shit. 

Then a few months ago I hit a really bad episode, my trauma was resurfacing, I was in wants called a mixed episode (which I explain as being sad, fast and impulsive) and then there was the relationship issues. My gf and I were in a rough patch and I was considering breaking up with her. While she was on a trip to another city for a week, I came onto Reddit and found someone who wanted to hurt me, just online. I called him and he instructed me to do some really heinous things to myself, while explaining my childhood trauma and jerking off. 

I know that's still cheating. I tried to tell myself it wasn't cheating cause I didn't get any joy from it. But I still sent someone videos of me nude and harming myself. 

I never told her

A few days later I attempted suicide and ended up on life support in a coma. It was in large part because of my trauma. I died but they managed to revive me. 

Time passed and so did the rough patch. I didng do it again for a while. And then one night, she falls asleep and I do it again. Then another night. Then I'm doing it regularly.

Tonight I made a post on a 'trauma kink"" subreddit asking people to get me to tell them all about my childhood sexual abuse.
I got probably close to 50 messages. I responded to almost all of them. I spent 10 hours sexting so many people. Telling them everything that's ever happened to me, listening to what they wanted to do to me, while they jerked off and you guessed it, I masturbated too. 

I told a guy that I want to get raped again but my gf (obviously) would never let me. He helped me figure out a plan for how I can get away with getting severely traumatized sexually again and get away with my gf not finding out. I actually toyed with the idea. 

The whole time my gf was sleeping peacefully next to me. At one point she woke up, rolled over and gave me a kiss and went back to sleep. I felt horrible 

When all was said and done and I was finished crying and the post not clarity kicked in, I felt awful. Like, kill myself again and hope they don't have a working defibrillator on hand kind of awful.  Like, check myself into the psych ward level awful. 

Idk what to do. 

And I'm not sleeping, or eating, or drinking water. I haven't slept in two days. I'm constantly in a state of hypersexual urges and trauma memories.

1j6f3x7,offmychest,That ‘Time of the Month’ and intrusive thoughts,"Hi reddit…I don’t really know how to start, or where this is going, but I needed somewhere to put this other than floating it around my head.

It’s the 2nd day of my (period) and the intrusive thoughts are winning again. 

I keep finding myself almost seeking tragic/traumatic content that makes me cry. It’s not quite compulsory but I notice throughout the day I’ll find myself crying over a sad post of someone losing their pet or someone’s partner dying and or generally anything to do with the state of humanity right now. I’m just consumed with grief. Mourning with those who are experiencing tragedy doesn’t give any comfort or relief and yet I keep circling back.

I always feel things deeply, always have since I was a sentient child, but during these 5 days (hell even the ~7 pre-menstrual days leading up to it), I feel an overwhelming sadness, and seem to ruminate over it. I know my hormones are fluctuating, but I feel this is becoming untenable. I can recognize my feelings of pain and sorrow and empathy, but that doesn’t stop me from seeking discomforting content or thoughts. I know social media is having a negative impact on me in this way, though I’m not active on IG or tiktok or YouTube as anything more than a consumer of content. I don’t spend more than an hour a day on ig, but I’m on my pc constantly to do work. 

I guess I really don’t know how to escape this grieving and mourning cycle during my menstrual cycle. It’s getting really difficult because for about 12 days out of one month, I’m battling these horrible thoughts. I don’t think that they’re suicidal ideation particularly as I dealt with that a LOT when I first hit puberty, but it’s a lot of unconscious and unwanted thought and behavior and I’m running out of ways to redirect myself. I have touched grass, and it’s very cold outside in the north eastern US.

Fwiw I’m autistic, I have a therapist, but relatively low support needs (or so I thought before typing all of this out and realizing how unstable it sounds). I don’t live with my parents and do go to school/work. I have a cat, she’s amazing, sometimes I look at her and cry too because she’s just so wonderful and supportive and silly and I never knew I could love a living creature so much.

I guess I just needed to get that out. Thanks for reading ❤️‍🩹",4,2,1741432821.0,"That ‘Time of the Month’ and intrusive thoughts Hi reddit…I don’t really know how to start, or where this is going, but I needed somewhere to put this other than floating it around my head.

She’s been extremely suicidal ever since then, but hasn’t been wanting anyone to intervene. About 2 weeks ago, she told me she tried to kill herself with pills, but just ended up throwing them back up and didn’t go to the ambulance because she knows they’ll put her on suicide watch, and she’s been on there before and doesn’t want that. I respected her wishes and didn’t say anything about it to anyone, but then she brought it up again while talking to a mentor at our school and broke down and told them she didn’t want to live anymore while I was in the room with them. I still left it alone even then. Today, she texted a groupchat with me and my two other friends at 1 a.m saying she was going to go be with her mom and that she loved us but this was goodbye. I saw it at 5 a.m when I woke up, tried to text her and called her twice and she didn’t answer so I called 911. She answered when they were already about to pull up at her house and said she tried to kill herself again and had been throwing up all night. I told her that she can never speak to me again if she pleases, but I called 911 because she didn’t answer.

1j6eapn,offmychest,I miss her so much and I shouldn’t.,"I’m not lying to myself about not wanting her back.
I don’t want her in any romantic capacity. But I do miss her. And I hate myself for it. It’s been years. I think I’m struggling more right now because next week is the 5th cycle around the sun of her walking out on me for her ex. It took me so long to get over the initial pain. For the most part I’ve moved on. But then it’s like March comes around and all
The residual feelings come back. I wish they didn’t.
It’s been so long I shouldn’t care anymore. I’ve been with other women, I try my best to actively better myself and focus on things I love. Hobbies, aspirations, goals, being the best version of myself I can. But in the back of my mind she resides constantly. She hurt me like nobody else in my life ever has. I’ve had various people betray me in life but never like her and never in such a cold way. But it’s pointless dwell on. Dwelling doesn’t change the facts and it doesn’t change the situation. But I can’t help how I feel. I miss our conversations. I miss our friendship. I miss her voice, her singing, her views on life, her art. I miss admiring how beautiful her eyes are. I swear I don’t want her back. But I do miss everything about her. And it drives me crazy. She treated me like trash. She had no remorse for what she did to me. She walked away like I never existed and I don’t exist to her now. So why do I still care so much? I’m doing all the right things. I’m exercising regularly. I’m in therapy. I again emphasize that I’m working on myself which includes these random periods like now where the swelling spikes. It’s not so random right now considering when it’s happening. But I’m so tired of it. I can’t control dreaming about her. I can’t control thinking about her. I hate I still wonder about how she’s doing. If she’s eating and taking care of herself, if she’s safe. These thoughts should not be running though my head right now but they are. I wish I wasn’t like this. I know as the month passes by I’ll feel normal again.

1j63w1r,offmychest,I Crave Sex ... But Forcing Myself Not To Have It Until I Find Someone Worth It Or My Future Husband. Worried It Will Never Happen At All Due To My Trauma.,"Ugh so I'm really upset and I hate myself because of this...I'm a 28 F almost 29 and I have been taking a break from dating and have been celibate for one month and a half now.

The reason why I decided to take a break because my last relationship 27 M at the time 26 M caused me such severe trauma (we broke up in August 2024 but he kept coming back just to start drama with me in and out till November 2024).

This stupid fucker (prior to breakup) unfortunately the best partner I had and the best sexual experience I have ever had unfortunately. I had suffered so much mistreatment prior to him, but my ex flipping the script and being even more horrible than the rest of the men I have dated prior (trust me it was bad) came as a shock. He was very nerdy like myself and we had so much in common to the T and we became very close (we talked every day on the phone 2-3 hours, involved friends and family, saw each other at least once a week, did activities together). The breakup still hurts me a lot. Just to be clear I do not miss him nor want him back at all this. Due to the last drama we had (which involved our mutual friends which he should off never been involved in) this man sent me to inpatient care I could off died because of him! Thats how severe we are talking.

I really do not want to have hookups or get into a non serious relationship anymore tbh im fucking done! I have had bad incidents in the past and my last partner was the straw that broke the camels back! I want the next person to date to be my future husband and I do not want to settle at all! Heres the requirements I have for my best partner basic:

1.1. Common Interests I am into EDM, cartoons and nerdy shit (Regular Show & Sonic The HedgeHog ect think like that), nights out to bars and clubs but also love chill nights in, working out, concerts, pop ups, day trips, and trying out new restaurants.

1.2. Great sex honestly common interests are legit tied for number 1 for a reason as I am very sexual person. I love men with big 🍆, dirty talk, and intimacy after sex is important to me.

2. Best Friend - Whats the point if they aren't.

3. Great Communication - If this isnt there whats the point as well.

4. Oddest one (needs to smoke pot) - I'm not even kidding it enhances intimacy for me and in the next 7-10 years i want to transition to california sober.

If any of these is off, I will literally depart. This isn't a joke.

Since August 2024, I have had 3 sexual encounters and been on 2 dates. The dates I had nothing in common with them and it wasn't the same vibe! The sexual encounters omg THEY WERE SO BAD! The last sexual encounter I had in mid January I legit masturbated for an hour than cried after because I miss having good sex (not with my ex I just want someone thats like him performance wise or preferred way better than him).

Having good sex for me is rare for me to find based on my preferences. I have a body count of 30 men and only 3 have managed to make me cum sober (the number is that low).

I'm seriously worried my future husband doesnt exist or is dead since I 100% believe I would off met them by now! Everyone from my past is either in a serious relationship, engaged, married, or pregnant. I have nothing just trauma after trauma. All my friends growing up think my dating luck is ridiculous. Thankfully where I live I have single friends so it makes dealing with the pain a tad easier.

I did see a shimmer of false hope recently and its good to know my attraction is not broken completely. On Valentine's Day I met a man at a singles event that I was really into and really my time and checked off all my boxes so far. He was a cute nerdy boy, had a proper job, we had so much in common, and he even did a weed edible with me at the venue! We did arrange a date but a few days he cancelled the date and he admitted he didnt want a serious relationship. Great he was honest but it makes me feel sad that guys that are my type are not into me at all. I find strangely men that are not my type are majority into me and I am not into them at all! Yes I have tried to give some a chance and date them to in the past but theres no spark on my end.

Since I stopped dating I legit have been focusing on myself and I feel mostly great. I am excelling at my new job and I became an asset to the business, doing a certificate in digital marketing, doing a fitness challenge at Orangetheory (we end this week and I finish my last class tomorrow), doing a bootcamp certificate in digital marketing, and focusing on my friendships. I feel great and how proud how far I have come since my hospitalization and I am giving myself credit.

The problem is that I get very lonely (way too lonely) and even if I wanted to date I'm too busy till end of March. But the issue is that I really miss having sex, but I know if I do I will be up for more disappointment and more heartbreak (I literally cant handle another heartbreak especially after last time since I almost died). I do watch a bunch of porn just to see if any men can replicate my preferences (surprisingly I saw one yesterday). Thats how lonely we are talking man!

What do I do? I do not want to settle for someone that I do not want and I am worried I'm gonna end up alone. I plan to start seriously date in April but with my track record I'm seriously scared if I get another heartbreak it will end me.",5,2,1741391274.0,"I Crave Sex ... But Forcing Myself Not To Have It Until I Find Someone Worth It Or My Future Husband. Worried It Will Never Happen At All Due To My Trauma. Ugh so I'm really upset and I hate myself because of this...I'm a 28 F almost 29 and I have been taking a break from dating and have been celibate for one month and a half now.

The reason why I decided to take a break because my last relationship 27 M at the time 26 M caused me such severe trauma (we broke up in August 2024 but he kept coming back just to start drama with me in and out till November 2024).

This stupid fucker (prior to breakup) unfortunately the best partner I had and the best sexual experience I have ever had unfortunately. I had suffered so much mistreatment prior to him, but my ex flipping the script and being even more horrible than the rest of the men I have dated prior (trust me it was bad) came as a shock. He was very nerdy like myself and we had so much in common to the T and we became very close (we talked every day on the phone 2-3 hours, involved friends and family, saw each other at least once a week, did activities together). The breakup still hurts me a lot. Just to be clear I do not miss him nor want him back at all this. Due to the last drama we had (which involved our mutual friends which he should off never been involved in) this man sent me to inpatient care I could off died because of him! Thats how severe we are talking.

I really do not want to have hookups or get into a non serious relationship anymore tbh im fucking done! I have had bad incidents in the past and my last partner was the straw that broke the camels back! I want the next person to date to be my future husband and I do not want to settle at all! Heres the requirements I have for my best partner basic:

1.1. Common Interests I am into EDM, cartoons and nerdy shit (Regular Show & Sonic The HedgeHog ect think like that), nights out to bars and clubs but also love chill nights in, working out, concerts, pop ups, day trips, and trying out new restaurants.

1.2. Great sex honestly common interests are legit tied for number 1 for a reason as I am very sexual person. I love men with big 🍆, dirty talk, and intimacy after sex is important to me.

2. Best Friend - Whats the point if they aren't.

3. Great Communication - If this isnt there whats the point as well.

4. Oddest one (needs to smoke pot) - I'm not even kidding it enhances intimacy for me and in the next 7-10 years i want to transition to california sober.

1j5wsr9,offmychest,I really wish I could forget everything and move on…,"I need to vent. I can’t do no contact with my ex because we share two children together it has extremely hard to keep minimal contact about the kids only. I had been with this man for 11 years. In December I found notes in his wallet. Notes that said “you’re so amazing, I love you my sexy bacon” (that’s how she spelled you’re) and another one that said “ I love you from your sexy marshmallow.” I confronted him later on that night after we had put our kids to sleep and the first thing he asked me was what did I want to do. As if he had no remorse or regret. In August or September, he told me he was working overtime. He usually goes in on first shift and he told me he was working overtime and had to be in at 12am. It was weird to me so I had someone go and check if his car was there and when they did, they told me it wasn’t. I was in denial, so I went to check. He wasn’t there. I came up with something to say that I needed to get a hold of him and that I had called his job to see if he was actually there. I told him that his job told me he wasn’t and there was no one by that name and he told me that he didnt report to anyone since it’s overtime so they actually didn’t know he was there. I told him I went to check and his car wasn’t there and he said that he supposedly had left for a bit to smoke. (He started smoking after having sleep apnea, but I didn’t know he did that while being at work) if he was even doing that. It’s wrong regardless. But then he texted me saying that he thought he was done and that things weren’t getting better. I will mention in 2021 I found out I was pregnant with our second and when I told him he wasn’t happy, I started to have a bit of resentment because he wasn’t as loving and caring as he was with our first. Fast forward to February of 2022 I lost my dad and I became depressed; through this whole thing and while being pregnant he was not supportive. He would dismiss and avoid me. When I was up crying he wouldn’t care. When I told him I hated my body after having our two sons ( I had c sections) he didn’t even care. I know it’s on me to love myself but when the person isn’t even telling you they love you regardless or reassuring in any way it’s so hard. It continued this way. I built up resentment towards him for this and other reasons. Like always picking his friends over me and our family. A day before my second son’s csection he chose to go out with his friends the night before. And did the same thing when I was pregnant with our first a few days before he was born it was our anniversary and he chose to go with his friends on our anniversary, he told me it was too late to cancel.  All of this and more caused resentment and made me feel a certain way towards him but I still kept trying. I kept trying to tell him how I felt or when I did being stuff up he would tell me he didn’t want to argue. If something did happen he wounds not come back to it and talk about things. He just suppressed everything. Fast forward to April of last year, this was a few months before  the overtime incident, we went on a trip and things were rough I was overwhelmed he kept telling me things weren’t the same. I was still grieving but for some reason I experienced my first panic attack before this trip and while on the trip it happened again because he was being distant around his family I felt like an outsider and like I was alone. I was having suicidal thoughts. He broke down at one point during the trip too and when I tried to comfort him he didn’t wanna talk he just shut down again and we didn’t speak much for the rest of that. Then we came back home and things were bas. We were even more distant. Fast forward to the overtime incident. When he told me he thought he was done. I was trying to sit down and talk to him figure out what he wanted to do and the whole time he kept saying idk. I kept telling him that if he wanted to real things off and leave that was his choice and I wasn’t gonna hold him back if he was unhappy, he just said idk every time I would ask. We were still living together he wasn’t sure what to do and it got to a point that as time went by he would not eat at home , he would not touch the groceries that I bought. He would not help with the outside maintenance and barely the inside, he used to help cook because I also work and he stopped doing that. Just feeding the kids simple things that he could do quickly. When I would talk to him he would ignore me. He would not say anything to me and he wouldn’t sleep with me. Earlier in the year he stopped being intimate with me. Said it didn’t feel right. That should’ve been a red flag. This was before our Trip. Anyway it continued this way until he made me feel like I hated him because he would treat me as if I didn’t exist in our own home. He would completely ignore my presence when I would ask something he wouldn’t even respond and I kept basically allowing it. Until December when I found those notes.. then it all made sense. I wanted to know why if I gave him chances to leave why didn’t he why didn’t he tell me that he wanted to be with someone else. I felt betrayed and I felt like I was pushing him away because I was depressed that it had to be me. It made sense when he stopped answering me messages or calls while he supposedly went out with friends and came back the next day around hotel check out times. I ended up putting two and two together. After finding out the notes. I gave him an ultimatum to go to therapy but he couldn’t keep seeing her and he could stay in our house and to that he said he didn’t know. I was so upset that he didn’t have remorse or regret it seemed like. If he wanted to be with me and the kids he would be showing some regret but he didn’t. I had a lot of anxiety so I told him he had to go stay at his moms and he did. His family was in shock about the situation he never mentioned this person or problems .I found out it was a coworker. I wanted answers and to know how long if it was since the beginning of last year or after our trip or when he started to be really cold towards me. But he never wanted to tell me. Our communication was bad I couldn’t talk to him without feeling anxious and he would avoid me even when it was about our kids he barely responded. At some point late January our communication I thought would get better. He told me he regretted not being supportive while I was pregnant and when my dad passed away so I thought maybe he was realizing things since he could wasn’t living in our house anymore. He found a house to rent. Maybe space was helping. I thought he had maybe stopped seeing this person after seeing everything that was caused and how it broke our home even more. I believe with communication it could’ve been worked out( I previously asked him to go to therapy with me when I was going for my loss and he said no) so I tried before too. Anyways I thought that he stopped being with her. So he didn’t want to give me his address and finally did and I just happen to drive by and seen this car parked in front of his house. I ended up finding the same car at his job and yes I shouldn’t have did this but I waited to see who it was. Also I will mention 3 months after my second son I seen text messages from a girl Named amanda telling him “stop it you know you look good” so it seems he was trying to find validation. But anyways I waited and when I seen the person that went to the car I was shocked I didn’t know if I should feel happy or mad. But I was upset that this person was older and it doesn’t matter but we’re 28 and she looks to be in her 40’s and I was just thinking like whyyy I imagined someone else. You get beautiful a RN he works at a hospital or something else. He just cleans and setups. But I drove next to her and I asked for her name, she told me a name and I asked her if she knew this person and she said yes he works in my department but I mostly work in the office. It made sense the sticky notes and then I asked are you by any chance seeing him and she said “hell no, hell no, the set up guy, I would never” I basically told her he was cheating on me and we’ve been together this long and have kids and I just really wanted to ask a question but she just denied it says she doesn’t know she barely sees him and works. I didn’t expect anything honestly she didn’t have to tell me anything but the way she reacted told me that she knew about me and our kids. I knew he would get mad and he did. He didn’t expect me to know who it was and obviously he knew I had drove by which he got upset and I didn’t do it again or ask her anything again. Then valentines came a week later and when he came to pick up our kids I seen he had his sweater over something I knew it was a gift. I don’t know why he still kept hiding this though but hia car was unlocked and I went in and looked and seen he got shirts that he doesn’t even typically wear. He’s not really into brands and they were brands. She got him candy he doesn’t eat or Chips that he doesn’t eat and a cologne he used to never wear and a envelope that said from your love. And not to mention alcohol if you care about someone and if you know them then she would know that he seems to have a little bit of a drinking problem so why would she encourage it. I would never get him alcohol in fact I told him that I thought he was drinking a bit too much which he agreed to. I keep thinking about our messages over analyzing everything. Wondering when it all started and why he picked her over trying to work things out. If the grass is really geeener on the other side. If she is really that great that he rather have thrown out 11 years and move out. If it was all worth moving out  and flipping our kids life upside down. Our sons are little yet my oldest kept asking me questions like why couldn’t daddy live with us or even asking what was wrong with him. Hearing him ask things breaks my heart, what did she have that I couldn’t give. Why wasn’t I worth it? Does he really love and care about this person that he treated me like ceao before I found out. Yet I still have him an ultimatum and  wanted for him to be sorry and tell me he wants to come back . He’s happy while I’m going to counseling, picking up our pieces in our home, depressed m, and dealing with anxiety. Why couldn’t he put the effort he’s putting with this woman with me? With our kids?? Was he ever gonna tell me?
 If you’ve read all this thank you! I really really needed to vent. It’s been so hard. I keep comparing myself and just wondering if she’s older then why the hotels why not her house. I thought she was young also because they were getting rooms maybe she lived with her parents or something but it just makes me think of all these things!!! I just needed to vent. Feeling like what if I wouldn’t have been depressed or I could’ve did this or that.. we got into an argument yesterday about communication and I kept trying to tell him that the people around him right now may not always be there but our kids will always be a part of him and he’s bonded to them and I’m also their mom therefore we will always be around each other so why not work on communication and coparenting and do things right to that he said nothing he does is good enough and that I’m bashing him because I told him I think you’re letting your mind get cloudy and you’re not seeing who truly matters and the bigger picture of it all, mind you I could say mean things to him because Friday our kids left with him and one came back with the same underwear and the other came back with same clothes as Friday. He said I dismiss how he feels and that I make feel like he’s not enough. Did I cause this? Did I cause for him to go Look somewhere else? To look for validation?

1j5viaw,offmychest,I feel like I wasted all my potential,"Sorry for bad English as it is not my first language.

I (24M) feel like I had everything to live a good life and slowly getting close to ruining it all. I graduated from college in summer 2023. I was the highest GPA in my generation of my major (industrial engineering) from the considered best university (I got full scholarship) in my country. During college I was able to get a scholarship to study abroad in Germany where I also landed an internship for a semester before coming back and finishing my bachelor's degree. During finals week in my last semester I landed a full time job as an industrial engineer in a big German company, in my home country. The thing is that my father used to work in that company in a higher position but in the same department a few years before I finished college. 

So once I started my job, I would get a lot of people talk to me and ask me if I was indeed my father's son. At first that didn't bother me at all, I was very happy that people had fond of memories of my father when he worked there. But slowly I started to feel that specially management would compare me with my dad, where if I did something good I would get compliments such as ""Just as a great engineer as your dad"", but if I made a mistake ""Your dad never made that mistake"". I started feeling like my father's shadow and I guess that slowly I stopped enjoying my job to the point that I felt that I studied the wrong major. 

I had my first anniversary at my job and during a family visit of an aunt, my father's sister, she had a stroke in my house which put her in the hospital in intensive care. My aunt didn't have insurance so the medical bills were covered mostly by my family once my aunt didn't have enough to pay. But there was a point where neither my family had enough to pay for my aunt's medical bills. This let me to choose to quit my job, both so I could use my resignation settlement to help pay my aunt's surgery, and also try to explore new departments. So I moved back with my parents and after my aunt was sent home I was the one that mostly took care of her, before she could go back to the city she lives.

Ever since July 2024 I have been unemployed, I had applied to many jobs, in the same field I used to work such as other fields where an industrial engineer could work, but i have been unlucky to land a job. Most companies that have rejected me have told me that if I wasn't unemployed they would contract me, others chose other candidates last second (one even when I had a job offer signed). So now I feel that maybe my decision to quit my job was not the best, but at the same time, I feel that at that time I didn't have a choice.

Now I also feel that my GF (25F) of six years is getting a bit desesperate that I haven't landed a job. She tells me that it is fine and soon I will get one, but when I tell her that one company rejected me after having several interviews I can see her desperation. She has asked several times if it really is that difficult to get a job. As she got hers within a month of graduating. My parents were supportive at first, but now they are also getting desperate. I'm close to run out of my savings, so also I'm starting to feel the pressure of not having money anymore.

Honestly I feel that I wasted the potential to grow in the company I had my first job and now that I'm unemployed and companies don't seem to be interested in me, I can't shake off the feeling that I'm failing my family, my girlfriend and myself.

Last month I started having suicidal thoughts and  now I constantly imagine what would happen if I died. I know there are people that care for me, but I can't stop thinking of myself as a failure.

If someone could give me advice in how to handle my emotions better or just any advice in general I would really appreciate it. Thanks for reading and sorry for the long post

I (24M) feel like I had everything to live a good life and slowly getting close to ruining it all. I graduated from college in summer 2023. I was the highest GPA in my generation of my major (industrial engineering) from the considered best university (I got full scholarship) in my country. During college I was able to get a scholarship to study abroad in Germany where I also landed an internship for a semester before coming back and finishing my bachelor's degree.

1j5plrh,offmychest,I have a shitty friend and don’t know what to do,"I'm going to keep this as anonymous as possible. I have a long distance friend and we've always been long distance. I met her through another friend at the time and we just clicked at the time. We've been friends at least 7 years. For the most part we text each other all the time, sometimes call or give the occasional podcast update on Snapchat. At least once a year we try to see each other but with money and flights and hotels it's been hard so really we stay long distance friends. 

Now at the beginning we both clicked really well like we were soul sisters but as time went on little red flags would come up or something that didn't sit right with me but I didn't care I was just happy to have someone to talk to and that understood me. I learned over time that she is either a pathological liar for attention or something else similar. She will say she has medical conditions that are serious and for me that's scary so I will suggest going to the doctor or a specialist, to which she would say something along the lines of ""oh the doctor said I don't have that but they are unsure so maybe I do?"" This happens a lot with suspected autoimmune diseases, cancers including lyphomas, arthritis, asthma, etc. for a long time she ""assumed"" she had a specific autoimmune disease which she never got tested for but she finally did get tested and she said ""the doctor says it doesn't look like I have it but I could"" now not to act high and mighty but I am in healthcare I know there are specific tests to diagnose the exact condition she thought she had and the doctors did those tests and I know they would've said yes you have it based on xyz or no you don't. There's not a maybe you do or don't for an autoimmune disorder like that. So each day basically she comes up with something new that's wrong with her or something that isn't right I think just looking for pity or attention and I'm over it. She thought she had cancer which isn't something to joke about. I've lost a family member to cancer so it's personal to me. I tried helping her or asking symptoms and for her bloodwork to see if I could find anything (which I didn't) she went to the doctor and they said nope your perfectly healthy and exactly what I told her about what she could be experiencing is what they told her and she didn't listen until the doctor said it. So after that I don't even care when she tells me i just say go to the doctor. I don't even help because she doesn't listen. 

The next big thing is money. She does not have any money or claims to be broke but works full time( which I understand in this economy really means nothing) but she has been working the same full time job as long as we've been friends for at least 7 or more years and in the beginning she had shared costs with a partner and she has shared costs with a new partner now. So she's not taking life on by herself, both people are working full time and from what I know make decent money. Now I'm not great with money either I'm still learning how to be adult in that sense because no one taught me how to save. But her family is pretty smart when it comes to money and have taught her what to do and she just doesn't. What bothers me is when she claims to have no money that she's in the negatives until her next check but goes and buys $200 worth of unnecessary stuff or will say like oh should I buy this and it's literally something she already has and doesn't use. I try to be senseful and say maybe that's not the best idea or sell that pair of shoes you don't wear if you want another pair. She wanted to take a loan out for a large amount of money to fix something for her boyfriend and I said maybe you shouldn't do that without discussing it together. She bought a house way to expensive for her annual income and assumed she'd be fine making payments. Within six months she had made 4 late payments and basically had to sell the house to even make up for how much she was behind. I'm not saying any of this to be mean because I care about her and I don't want to see anyone suffer but what bothers me is that multiple people will say this is a bad idea or maybe you should think it over and she doesn't. 

Our friendship has turned into her really only talking about herself and her problems but when I am experiencing something I just get one little sentence on like ""oh I'm sorry"" and then she's back to talking about herself. I realize long distance friendships are hard but it just seems like she surrounds herself with people that enable her and I just can't do it. It's gotten really annoying. But anytime I try to bring anything up she always has a narcissistic response and shuts down and starts just saying ok or sorry to anything I say like a child. She also has a history of self harm and threatening to kill her self so I'm afraid if I say like I really don't like how our friendship is going she'll just threaten to self harm. She also knows where I live as she's been here before and I can't really just up and leave I mean I live in a nice house with my partner. There's so many things stopping me but at the same time I don't know how much more I can take.

1j5lwd7,offmychest,"I love her, you should know.","So I'm a about to tell a story, one that since it happened I haven't been able to tell in the way i need to, so sorry if it's too long.

I'm currently 18, back in 2020 when I was 13, I changed school and met this girl, she's weird as me, and due to family issues, she was emotionally unstable, chronically depressed and suicidal. For me, I have difficulty on feeling empathy, and very insecure and self blaming.
We were just classmates but by the end of the year we became bestfriends and bonded due to our shit and lonely lifes plus pandemic.

Thing kept kind of good next years, we got very close although our lives took separate ways due to me changing school again.

I loved her a fucking lot, she was my favorite person in my life, not my only friend but the only one I could talk about my emotions, and feel understood, the only person I've shown myself vulnerable.

So 2024 arrives, and for some reason we start talking every day again, to a point that she falls in loves with me on June I think, and although I don't wanted to, I fall as well and confess to her, that was arround July 24th.

Before that, all my relationship attempts were a failure due to mainly mistakes I made.

So she's my girlfriend and everything is beautiful, I'd like to emphasize that this relationship felt different, like Long-lasting,sincerely.

And two weeks later her parents decide to move to Spain on September. Everything went to shit, on her, to the fact that she's moving from country and leaving behind everything she's got, that her family is a worse chaos that already was, that her mental state is fucked up. Her world was collapsing.

I started panicking about loosing her the moment she let knew she was moving, I was reminded of my last failures and I let myself be leaded by fear, and stopped thinking about her mental state, i forgot to care about her.

So after that chaos, I notice, I've hurt her...In a way I still don't have Idea of how much but it was serious...

A lot happened during August, everyday was a story on it's own, I kinda became paranoic and although my mistakes were the worst, she did some bad things on me, so we pretty much became toxic.

She's hurt, I'm hurt as well the thing is I caused my own pain, so with the guilt and frustration the last bullet arrived, that last week we agreed on being friends, I didn't wanted, cause after all, I still had feelings to her but it was that or nothing until, the last day a post of her made feel sickened as it seemed like she was asking to have a boyfriend. It was a lapse of like 4 - 5 days.

I've never had difficulty on letting someone go, I don't like keep being friends so I just block them, yet with her I just refused again and again to letting her go, and it wasn't just that moment, she was the only person in my life not only that I always tried to care about and keep around my life, but that I never imagined not being in life I just never think about that as a real possibility.

But I knew that I couldn't take no more. So I convinced myself to just block her momentarily while I heal and then come back again... but deep inside I knew it, the moment I saw her profile and button ""are you sure you want to block___?"" It's stuck in my head, I swear for some reason I felt like I was holding and gun pointing to her head, I know sounds dramatic and exaggerated, but I swear it felt like that, after I clicked that button I felt the worst - most intense pain i ever felt in my life, a part of me died that day and  I still want to cry when I remember this part. 
She's gone... The person I loved the most, the one I thought will always be with me, the one I was planning a future with just a few weeks ago...

How unfair it felt, I was frustrated as I've never been, emphasize that I always feel like I never had the opportunity to actually show how much I love her, neither when I'm talking about her or when showing to actual her.

6 months have passed since that day, I actually took a positive mind, I kind of focused on my life, becoming a better person, in success but specially in a good person...
 
It doesn't hurt nearly as much as it did 6 months ago, but considering how easy I let go, it surprises me and I feel like I'm missing something, I still feel guilty for my mistakes, I still feel bad even when I'm having fun, I still feel sexually attracted, I miss girl, I miss my best friend, I miss the person who made feel understood and loved...

I don't know how many conclusions are there left to get, I know that maybe the story sometimes feels weird, like incomplete or with some details not spoken enough, just know that I've already think a lot about the whole situation, and that this is pretty much the story of a person's whole teenage years.

I know I'm young, that I have to love myself and all that, I'm working it (just don't have money to go therapy), in part I needed to get this off, feel heard, in the other part I feel like a more objective point of view could help me process this better...

some days, i get up and all i want to do is roll over and die. i hate myself so much, and i have for five years. i don’t understand why some people get dealt shitty cards from the start, and others get to grow up fine. it doesn’t make any sense. all of my teachers are mad that i’m slacking off, but they don’t understand. i can’t focus. i’m so beyond exhausted that it’s just become an impossible task. i truly do not see the benefit in continuing on. 

no, i will not “find my people”, and it does not get better. it really, really doesn’t. i can’t comprehend why people say that. 

i do not plan on waking up tomorrow. i am not going to school, and i will not come out of my room. i know it’s permanent. and i know some people don’t actually want to die, but im not one of those people. there is absolutely nothing ahead of me. i’m done.",2,0,1741342621.0,"just fed up honestly hi,

some days, i get up and all i want to do is roll over and die. i hate myself so much, and i have for five years. i don’t understand why some people get dealt shitty cards from the start, and others get to grow up fine. it doesn’t make any sense. all of my teachers are mad that i’m slacking off, but they don’t understand. i can’t focus. i’m so beyond exhausted that it’s just become an impossible task. i truly do not see the benefit in continuing on. 

no, i will not “find my people”, and it does not get better. it really, really doesn’t. i can’t comprehend why people say that. 

i do not plan on waking up tomorrow. i am not going to school, and i will not come out of my room. i know it’s permanent. and i know some people don’t actually want to die, but im not one of those people. there is absolutely nothing ahead of me. i’m done.",0.5912151004914645,0.03640227345653746,Negative,High-Risk

1j5eogx,offmychest,I was sexually abused by my boyfriend during psychosis.,"I am 23F. I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia for three years and used to struggle with brief psychotic episodes before being medicated as of a year ago. The year I was diagnosed, I started dating my boyfriend at the time (25M). Not too long after we started talking, he began sending sexual texts, and I would reciprocate out of a feeling of obligation. I knew I shouldn't. But I did anyway because I wanted him to like me. Even though his advances made me uncomfortable. 

Fast forward to our first in-person date. I was very shy but all went okay until he parked to drop me off. He grabbed my shoulder and said ""I love you."" It scared me and I felt myself freezing. It was at this point that I started to have an episode because catatonia is one of my symptoms. Being aware of my condition, he acted concerned and walked me back to my dorm. I was having trouble walking. And then he came inside my room with me and shut the door. He laid me down on the floor and he started kissing me and put his hand down my pants. I was able to get his hand out of my pants but I let him kiss me. I was so afraid the entire time, but I kissed him back. He left when he was finished. 

Someone apparently saw him with me when we were outside the dorm and reported him because I was in distress. I denied any accusations of assault because I was ashamed and didn't want him to get in trouble. 

The sexual texts continued and got progressively more explicit. He started asking for photos. I obliged. I always gave in and I hate myself for it. He would text me in the middle of the night saying he was horny, and I would help him get off. I lied and lied and lied saying that I liked it when he talked to me that way.

We kept going on dates but then he started acting different. He would repeat what he did on the first date, grabbing me suddenly or shouting to try to scare me. It would work sometimes, and I would have a brief episode of catatonia and then he would touch me. I kept lying, telling him I liked it when he touched me and used me that way. 

He kept me a secret from his family. He only praised me for being ""low maintenance"" and ""not like other girls."" When I would venture to express my true feelings, he accused me of being ""hysterical"" and ""too sensitive."" He told me, ""There is not a single thing you know that I do not."" When he got angry, it scared me even more. Once, he even shoved and slapped me. 

Then one day I told him I didn't want him to sleep over. He told me he would sleep in his car in my dorm parking lot ""since I made him drive all the way"" for our date. I felt guilty and let him sleep over anyway, since I couldn't make him leave. That night, he told me he was sleeping in jeans because he was afraid that he might rape me in my sleep. I told him he wouldn't. He said he really thought he might.

The night after he left, I had a full psychotic break and thought in order to save ""our baby"" (the baby we never had since we never had sex) from being born, I had to hang myself. So I did. But the belt broke and I lived. I checked myself into a hospital and they sent me into solitary confinement at an institution. 

My boyfriend drove me back from the institution and walked me back to my room. He gestured to my failed setup, chair and belt and all, and said ""I leave for one moment and this is what you do?"" And he laughed. And I slapped him. He responded by grabbing me and kissing me forcefully before leaving. I broke up with him over the phone a day later, once I was safe at home a state away. 

I confessed to my family all that had happened. They were very disappointed in me and in him. I hate myself. I should have stopped him. I should have said no. And none of it feels real. It's been three years and it still doesn't feel real. I check his public Twitter every day in hopes that he will confess what he did, as he tweets things like ""moral of the story: never date a mentally ill woman"" and bemoans being single. I know I shouldn't hope for a confession or even look at his Twitter. But I do anyway. Just as I was with him, I allow it to happen. He still has that power over me. 

Did I deserve what happened to me? Did I lead him on? Please help me. I cannot continue like this.

1j5d9co,offmychest,My wife is about to die. We got married last month.,"My wife is 27 years old. I am 31. We have no kids. She has lived with several conditions most of her life. 

Tetralogy of fallot (heart), asthma, pcos etc. 

We've been together 3 years. I married her one month ago. 

She had a procedure to expand the valve on her heart... It was supposed to be a day surgery. Keyhole. Less invasive

She started coughing up blood. 2 days later they discovered they punctured a lung. She hasn't stopped since then. 

They tried a second procedure to stop the bleeding. Apprently it was successful but she's still coughing up blood. 

Everything is happening so fast. All the doctors have become silent and avoidant of me as I started pinging fingers of negligence. I don't blame them fully. She's a complex case but they took too long to admit the mistake and act. 

Yes she would have needed the procedure anyway but this was supposed to extend her life not shorten it. I wish we never agreed to it. I hate myself for the hope I thought it'd bring. 

My wife is about to die. At 27. She's in a heart failure ward surrounded by people aged 65+.

This stage of waiting feels like the worst. I've been following her blood test results. Seeing her conditions change. Her body is shutting down. She's been a fighter most of her life. At 27 she's already had 4 open heart procedures. 

Her family and friends are all hopeful asking me when she's leaving. I don't know how to tell them that she's not.

My wife keeps taking about going home. The future. It's just not fair. I keep crying. We just started marriage. Planned the year. I feel robbed. I am scared of the void that is to come. The darkness. 

She is everything to me. My best friend.. I've never met a woman like her. I never will.",7369,256,1741315144.0,"My wife is about to die. We got married last month. My wife is 27 years old. I am 31. We have no kids. She has lived with several conditions most of her life.

1j55ll9,offmychest,My mum always starts arguments with me and calls me names,"Part of the reason I'm making this post is because my therapist recommended to get it all out in writing. After all, every session I have with her, I talk about how my mother is treating me

I (F22) recently moved back home after University. Before I left for university, my mum and I would argue, but during university, since I didn't live at home, we barely did.

Before uni, my mum would hit me and yell at me constantly - for even the tiniest things. Recently, I finished uni and came back home to live with my parents. And it seems like my mum is making up for 4 years of no arguments.

I have to walk around eggshells around her. The littlest thing can set her off into an argument with me. If I don't give her the exact response she wants, then she begins an argument. If I forget, or don't even notice some chore I can do in the house, she begins an argument. A couple of nights ago, I was feeling really dizzy (which my mum knows happens) but my mum was going to bed at like 4pm because she was tired, so she asked me to cook my dad's dinner for him. I explained that I was really dizzy. She got mad at me and accused me of lying, even though she knows I get dizzy. I later went downstairs at 5pm to get some water to hopefully help my dizziness. I saw a note my mum left on the workspace to dad about his dinner. She called me an 'ungrateful lazy cow' because I couldn't make his dinner - despite me explaining I was very dizzy 

I can't go a week without my mum calling me names. A cow, a disgrace, selfish, rude, horrid. I can be blunt sometimes - especially when in a bad mental place. But i never mean to be rude. I always apologise to her when she accuses me of being rude - but i never, ever get any sort of apology from her. Not for the names she calls me, not for how worthless and unloved she makes me feel, not for how she talks to me like im a disgrace, nothing. And my dad hears us arguing, and my mum gets mad at me for making my dad worry, when she is almost always the one that starts the arguments. Just reading through my texts with her, I can tell how much she seems to dislike me. But then she'll come into my room sobbing and saying how she's a bad mum and wife - and I have to put how she's treated me behind me so i can comfort and reassure her.

My dad has never thought these things about me. My mental illness makes me believe my mum - that I'm just a terrible daughter and deserve to die. She knows I'm suicidal. Yet she seems to just always want an argument. And then she will come in crying about how shit her life is and how she's a bad mum and wife. 

I won't even get started on her obvious favoritism for my sister. That's a whole other can of worms.
